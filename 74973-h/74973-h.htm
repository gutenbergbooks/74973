<p>Many a book has been written about the Medici; yet how little has been
said about the private lives of the founders of that wonderful family
which rose from prosperous middle-class condition to take its place
among the sovereign houses of Europe, to seat its daughters on the
throne of the Queen-consorts of France, and its sons on the Chair of
St. Peter? Their rival capitalists north of the Alps climbed high in
those days when the gulf was dug deep between nobles and all who were
below them in the social scale. The Fuggers made many alliances with
the German and Bohemian nobles, and the Welsers had the unheard-of
glory of mating one of their daughters with the Emperor of Germany;
does not the Philipine-Welser Strasse in Augsburg commemorate to this
day the renown of the match? But neither had the fortune to found a
dynasty as did the Medici. They are so inseparably connected with the
history of their native city that the biographies have insensibly
become sketches of Florentine, even of European history. The men and
women have disappeared, and we see instead the dexterous manipulators
of tortuous Italian diplomacy, or the splendid patrons of art and
literature during the best period of the Renaissance. Yet, in our day,
we sometimes like to turn aside from the stage life to learn about the
<i>vie intime</i> of personages who have become historical. We are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</span>
curious about their doings within the home circle, about their private
loves and hates, whether they were good or bad husbands and wives,
parents and children. The simpler human interests attract us.</p>

<p>This book attempts to supply such details. It is founded on letters,
for the most part private, of Medici men, women, and children, and
their friends, written during those decades when the family was being
moulded for the great European destiny which lay hidden in the future
before it. In these old-world epistles Contessina artlessly displays
her household economies, Lucrezia reveals her fondness for bathing,
Clarice quarrels with no less a tutor than the celebrated Poliziano
about the lessons he gave to her children, and the child Piero tells
his father how he has studied hard, even writing in Latin, “in order to
give a more literary tone to my letters,” and proudly and persistently
demands the pony promised as a reward for diligence.</p>

<p>The materials have been gathered from many a quarter. Angelo Fabroni’s
ponderous tomes, <i>Magni Cosmi Medicei Vita</i> and <i>Laurentii
Medicis Magnifici Vita</i>; the Histories of Florence by Giovanni
Cavalcanti, Giovanni Cambi, and Niccolὸ Machiavelli; rare pamphlets,
published in small editions of twenty-five or a hundred copies, by
Italian men of letters in honour of the marriage of some friend,
which are a mine of wealth; and last, but not least, the Florentine
Archives. Most of the letters from the <i>Archivio Medicei ante
Principato</i> have never been published before, much less translated;
others are given here in full, which have hitherto seen the light only
in very fragmentary form. The volume can therefore claim to contain
a great deal of thoroughly original matter. In them it will be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</span> seen
that well-born or important men and women were addressed as Your
Magnificence, and written to and spoken of as The Magnificent. It was,
therefore, no special title bestowed on Lorenzo de’ Medici, but suiting
so well with his character and whole personality it has become, as it
were, his property.</p>

<p>My best thanks are due to Cavaliere Angelo Bruschi, librarian of the
Marucelliana Library in Florence, without whose valid assistance and
advice I should have had great difficulty in collecting the letters;
to Dr. Dorini of the Florentine Archives, whose aid was invaluable in
helping me to decipher the almost illegible manuscripts; and to Signor
Gugliemo Volpi, several of whose pamphlets and articles are quoted. I
must also thank the Baroness Mollinary of Como for so kindly having
photographed for me her most interesting early portrait of Lorenzo the
Magnificent, never before published; and Dr. Giovanni Poggi, director
of the Bargello in Florence, for giving me the photograph of Lorenzo’s
portrait at Poggio a Caiano. The Baroness Mollinary’s picture is one
of the many that belonged to her ancestor Paolo Giovio, and bears a
strong resemblance to the fine miniature of Lorenzo, the property of
M. Prosper Villon, reproduced in <i>Le Musée de Portraits de Paul
Jove</i> by M. Eugène Muntz, in which, however, Lorenzo looks rather
older. Both show the same humorous, kindly face, with a strong mouth,
determined jaw, and fine eyes. In the miniature the head and shoulders
are against and under a baldaquin, on each side of which is a small
bit of landscape. Below is inscribed <i>Laur M P P</i> and the Medici
arms (with six balls), surmounted by Lorenzo’s device, three ostrich
feathers, white, green, and red (faith, hope, and charity), while a
floating ribbon behind bears his motto <i>Semper</i>. The portrait at
Poggio<span class="pagenum" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</span> a Caiano is perhaps by Alessandro Allori, therefore of course
not contemporary; it may be a copy of an older and lost picture. I
must also express my great gratitude to the Rev. Principal Lindsay of
Glasgow for kind help and criticism during the progress of my work.</p>

<p>The portrait of Piero de’ Medici in the chapel of the Riccardi palace,
by Benozzo Gozzoli, has been given sometimes as that of his father
Cosimo, or even of his son Lorenzo. But if the bust by Mino da Fiesole,
in the Bargello, represents Piero, then he is the man grasping his
horse’s mane with one hand as he rides by the side of his father
Cosimo, who, as we know, generally rode a mule.</p>

<p>The ancestors given to the Medici are many, and their origin is not
easy to trace amid the conflicting accounts of friends and foes. The
latter declare they sprang from the very dregs of the people, and that
a charcoal-burner in the Mugello was their progenitor, whose son was a
doctor (<i>medico</i>). Their friends say they descend from Perseus,
from a Roman consul, or even from an emperor. Others state that a
brave knight, Averardo de’ Medici, came into Italy with Charlemagne
and killed the fierce giant Mugello, who for years had kept Tuscany
in bondage; while those who cling to the <i>medico</i> story, on
account of the name, tell of a learned physician who saved the life
of Charlemagne by applying cupping-glasses of his own invention. The
well-known arms, six red balls on a field or, are accounted for in as
many different ways. Doctors’ pills, cupping-glasses, apples from the
gardens of the Hesperides, dents made by the giant’s mace on Averardo’s
golden shield, and heads of enemies slain in battle by a valiant knight
who killed eleven of his assailants, because the oldest shield of the
Medici bore eleven balls.</p>

<p>According to genealogists the real progenitor of the Medici was a
certain Giambuono. He appears to have been a priest, as is indicated in
an ancient inscription on the wall of the church of the Assumption near
S. Piero a Sieve in the Mugello. What is certain is that the family
owned houses and towers in Florence in the twelfth century in the
Piazza de’ Medici, afterwards called de’ Succhiellinai, near the church
of S. Tommaso, which was in the Ghetto, now swept away. There a little
inn, Del Porco, used to be pointed out as standing where once was the
loggia of the family.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span></p>

<p>We have historical proof of the brothers Chiarissimo and Bonagiunta
de’ Medici, descendants of Giambuono. Chiarissimo was a member of the
council which made an alliance with the Sienese against Semifonte in
the Val d’Elsa, when that strong castle was razed to the ground in
1201. Ardingo, a great-grandson of Bonagiunta, was the first of the
family to hold high office in Florence. He became Prior of the city in
1291, Gonfalonier of Justice in 1296, and again in the following year.
This proves decisively that the Medici were not of the old nobility,
which had been excluded from all magisterial offices by a law passed
in 1293, called the <i>Ordinamenti della Giustizia</i>, which Bonaini
terms the Magna Charta of the Republic of Florence.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Ardingo’s
brother Guccio, who was Gonfalonier in 1299, made himself so popular
that when he died he was buried with great pomp in a sarcophagus of
the fourth century, which stood outside the baptistery. Later it was
removed into the cathedral, and in the eighteenth century was placed
in the courtyard of Palazzo Riccardi (once Medici), where it still is.
The cover, bearing the Medici arms and those of the Arte della Lana,
or Guild of Wool, to which Guccio belonged, was made by order of the
Priors at the time of his burial.</p>

<p>In 1314 another of the family, Averardo, was Gonfalonier of Justice,
and one of his grandsons, Filigno di Conte de’ Medici, has left
<i>Ricordi</i>, or Memoirs, written in 1373, which show how rich and
influential the Medici had already become. The book, which still exists
in the Florentine archives, was evidently once bound in vellum; the
frontispiece is decorated with the Medici arms, six red balls on a
field or, and the shield is surmounted by the head and paws of a black
wolf rising out of what looks like the coronet of a modern Marquess.</p>

<p>Addressing his children he writes:</p>

<p>“In the name of God and of his blessed Mother Madonna Saint Mary, and
of the whole Court of Paradise, who will I pray give us grace to act
and to speak well.</p>

<p>“I, Filigno di Conte de’ Medici, seeing the late misfortunes of civil
and foreign wars and the terrible mortality from the plague sent by
our Lord God to this earth, which we fear he may send again as our
neighbours have it, will write down<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span> the things I see which may be
needful for you who remain or who come after me, so that you can find
them if need be for any emergency. I pray you to write well in the
future and to preserve those lands and houses which you will find
inscribed in this book; most of them were bought by the noble knight
Messer Giovanni di Conte, my brother of honoured memory, after whose
death I began to write this book, taking from his records and from
those of others. I beg you will take care of it and keep it in a secret
place so that it may not fall into other hands, also because it may
be necessary to you in the future as it is now to us, who have to
find papers of one hundred years ago, for reasons which you will find
written, because States change and have no durability.</p>

<p>“Also I beg of you to preserve not only the riches but the position
attained by our ancestors, which is considerable but ought to be
higher. It begins to decline on account of a dearth of capable men, of
whom we once had many.</p>

<p>“Such was our greatness that it used to be said, ‘Thou art like one of
the Medici,’ and every man feared us; even now when a citizen does an
injury to another or abuses him, they say, ‘If he did thus to a Medici
what would happen?’ Our family is still powerful in the State by reason
of many friends and much riches, please God preserve it all to us. And
to-day, thank God, we number about fifty men.</p>

<p>“Since I was born about one hundred of our men have died; there are
but few families and we are badly off for children, that is to say
there are few. I write this book in several parts. First I shall note
certain facts which are useful to know, then the dowers and as many
papers as I can collect, the bills of sale and such like, then all the
purchases and who drew up the deeds, and then all the houses and lands
we possess....”</p>

<p>Page 84 is interesting as showing where the houses of the Medici stood
in Florence, and also that Cafaggiuolo belonged to them in early times.</p>

<p>“In the name of God amen.</p>

<p>“Here I inscribe all our lands and their boundaries and where they are
situated, and the houses in Florence, and what possessions came to us
from Conte our father in the division made between the brothers (that
is the late Conte,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span> Messer Jacopo, Messer Giovenco the knight, Talento,
Francesco and Chiarissimo) of the inheritance of their father Averardo,
those bought by Conte and also those bought by Messer Giovanni di
Conte, knight, together with myself Filigno, and Jacopo and Michele,
our brothers, during their life. To-day I begin to write and to cause
Michele my son also to write on account of the fatigue, and of not
being a good penman. God grant we do well.—1373, in February.</p>

<p>“A house with shops in front in the parish of S. Tommaso in the Mercato
Vecchio in Florence; the first side fronts the street or rather the
Mercato Vecchio, the second boundary is ours, the third is the street
wherein stands S. Tommaso, the fourth is Talento di Chiarissimo de’
Medici and ourselves. Adjoining this house are two others, three
smaller ones and several shops.... Also a palace with a courtyard, an
orchard and a well, in the parish of S. Lorenzo of Florence, in Via
Larga di S. Marco. The confines are first the said street; secondly
the sons of Tantini with a common wall between us, saving that what is
above their roof belongs to us and to Baglo di Dante, with the wall of
our courtyard below; the third is the inn of the Cock, now the property
of Niccolò di Cristofano di Geri Gazza, &amp;c.; the fourth is the palace
of Andrea Franceschi and Francesco di Biccio de’ Medici. A house is
annexed to this palace....</p>

<p>“In the name of God amen. Possessions in Mugello.</p>

<p>“The half of a palace with houses around it, a courtyard, a loggia
and a wall and moat, with an orchard outside in Cafaggiuolo in the
parish of S. Giovanni in Petroio, with the sixth part of the interior
courtyard, and the old walls, and all other things pertaining thereto
that are in the division. The broad road is to be 7 feet 8 inches wide
round the old enclosure of Cafaggiuolo, so that the sons of Messer
Giovenco cannot prevent us from using the road in front of the palace
and by their wall, as far as the bridge. The moat round Cafaggiuolo is
entirely ours as it touches our walls.”<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>A cousin of Filigno, Salvestro de’ Medici, led the Florentine troops
against Giovanni Visconti, Archbishop and Lord of Milan, and was
knighted on the battlefield of Scarperia. Gonfalonier of Justice in
1370, when Florence was distracted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span> by the rivalry of the Guelphs
and Ghibellines, he, being a Ghibelline, took the side of the people
against the nobles, and advocated enforcing the enactments of the
<i>Ordinamenti della Giustizia</i>, which excluded the nobles from
power. But for the moment he failed, and was nigh being exiled when
his name was again drawn from the <i>borsa</i>, or ballot-bag, as
Gonfalonier in 1378. Once more he proposed to apply the law against the
Guelph nobles, and meeting with opposition, threatened to resign. One
of his friends then appealed to the populace, and the result was the
Ciompi riot. The mob broke into the Palazzo de’ Priori and the Palazzo
del Podestà, burnt many palaces, and knighted sixty-four citizens in
the Piazza della Signoria, of whom Salvestro was the first.</p>

<p>His popularity is shown by a sonnet addressed to him by Franco
Sacchetti, author of many tales, who rather profanely calls him “non
gia Salvestro, ma Salvator mundi.” Salvestro was, however, a canny
burgher and made some profit out of the revolution, as the rents of
the shops on the Ponte Vecchio were assigned to him. Henceforward the
Medici were looked upon as the friends and defenders of the people
against the <i>Grandi</i> or nobles.</p>

<p>The founder of the line of citizens who ruled Florence like princes
was Giovanni d’Averardo, surnamed Bicci, de’ Medici, born in 1360. He
was several times a Prior, and in 1421 Gonfalonier of Justice. During
the Councils of Basel and Constance he made a fortune in exchange,
and being charitable was much beloved by the people. His popularity
increased when, against his advice, the nobles insisted on advancing
to meet the Duke of Milan instead of waiting for him to attack them in
Tuscany, with the result that at Zagonara the Florentines were beaten.
The expenses of the war exhausted the treasury, and disturbances
broke out in Florence. The nobles, fearing a repetition of the Ciompi
riots, attempted to form a government of <i>Ottimati</i>, as the party
of the oligarchy were called, and thus undermine the power of the
minor guilds. Some even suggested seizing the property of charitable
confraternities in order to obtain money. Giovanni de’ Medici was
consulted, and declared he would have nothing to do with such robbery.
A few years later he successfully advocated the abolition of the odious
system of forced loans, and the institution of the <i>catasto</i>,
which regulated all the taxes to be paid to the Commune of Florence.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
He then became the idol of the people. Cavalcanti writes that when
he lay dying on 20th February 1429, “he called his sons Cosimo and
Lorenzo, and in the presence of their mother, Piccarda Bueri, of
their wives, and of other citizens, spoke to them thus: ‘Beloved
sons, neither I nor any man born into this world should feel grief at
exchanging worldly cares for perpetual repose. I know that the last
days of my life are nigh, and where timid or foolish women or cowardly
men would feel sorrow, I feel great joy. I leave you in possession of
the great wealth which my good fortune has bestowed upon me, and which
your good mother and my own hard work has enabled me to preserve. I
leave you with a larger business than any other merchant in the Tuscan
land, and in the enjoyment of the esteem of every good citizen and of
the great mass of the populace, who have ever turned to our family
as to their guiding star. If you are faithful to the traditions of
your ancestors, the people will be generous in giving you honours. To
achieve this, be charitable to the poor, kindly and gracious to the
miserable, lending yourselves with all your might to assist them in
their adversity. Never strive against the will of the people, unless
they advocate a baneful project. Speak not as though giving advice,
but rather discuss matters with gentle and kindly reasoning. Be chary
of frequenting the Palace; rather wait to be summoned, and then be
obedient, and not puffed up with pride at receiving many votes. Have
a care to keep the people at peace, and to increase the commerce of
the city. Avoid litigation or any attempt to influence justice, for
whoso impedes justice will perish by justice. I leave you clear of
any stain, for no evil deed has been committed by me. Thus I bequeath
glory and not infamy to you as a heritage. I depart joyfully and with
more happiness if you do not enter into party strife. Be careful not
to attract public attention. I commend to you Nannina my wife and your
mother, see that after my death ye change not the habits and customs of
her life. Pray to God for me, my sons, that my passage may be crowned
by the salvation of my immortal soul. Now take my blessing. Cosimo, see
that Lorenzo be kindly and a good brother; and thou, Lorenzo, honour
Cosimo as the elder.’ Saying this, he passed from this life.”<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p class="center">(1389-1464)</p>


<p>Of Giovanni di Bicci de’ Medici’s two sons, Cosimo was by far the most
remarkable. “The father,” writes Gibbon, “of a line of princes, whose
name and age are almost synonymous with the restoration of learning;
his credit was ennobled into fame; his riches were dedicated to the
service of mankind; he corresponded at once with Cairo and London, and
a cargo of Indian spices and Greek books were often imported in the
same vessel.” For even when most deeply engaged in political matters,
Cosimo always found time to attend to his business, and himself
conducted the correspondence with the heads of the banks which were
known throughout Europe and in Asia. All had orders to buy ancient
manuscripts and rare books. As a lad he served in the Pisan war, and
in 1414 was sent by his father in the suite of Pope John XXIII. to
represent the bank at the Council of Constance. After the flight of the
Pope, Cosimo left Constance in disguise and returned to Florence, where
he was elected a Prior of the city in 1415, and again in 1417.</p>

<p>Cosimo was forty when his father died in 1429. Ammirato describes
him as of middle height, with an olive complexion, and of imposing
presence. Machiavelli says that he applied himself so strenuously to
increase the political power of his house that “those who had rejoiced
at Giovanni’s death, now regretted it, perceiving what manner of man
Cosimo was. Of consummate prudence, staid yet agreeable presence,
Cosimo was liberal and humane. He never worked against his party nor
against the State, was prompt in giving aid to all, and his liberality
gained him many partisans among the citizens. Chief amongst those
who helped to consolidate his power were Averardo de’ Medici and
Puccio Pucci—Averardo by his audacity, Puccio by his prudence and
sagacity, augmented his popularity and greatness. The advice and the
sane judgment of Puccio<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span> were so highly esteemed and so well known
by all that Cosimo’s party was not called by his name but by that of
Puccio.”<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>Much of Cosimo’s influence and popularity, no doubt, arose from his
generosity to men of letters. When Niccolò de’ Niccoli, “censor of
the Latin tongue,” ruined himself by buying books, Cosimo opened an
unlimited credit for him at his bank. After Niccoli’s death he paid his
debts on the condition of being allowed to dispose of the collection of
manuscripts, amounting to six hundred volumes. Four hundred he gave to
the library of S. Marco, the rest he kept or distributed among friends.
Cosimo also provided Tommaso Parentucelli, Bishop of Bologna, with what
money he needed; a service that was well repaid when the Bishop became
Pope, and made him his banker. Parentucelli catalogued de’ Niccoli’s
library, and noted for Cosimo the books that were necessary to complete
it. This catalogue Vespasiano declared to be indispensable to all
collectors of books. When the Badia of Fiesole, certainly designed, if
not actually built by Brunelleschi at Cosimo’s expense, was finished,
he summoned Vespasiano, who has recorded their conversation: “One day,
when I was in his room, he said to me, ‘What plan can you suggest for
the formation of this library?’ I answered that to buy the books would
be impossible, since they could not be purchased. ‘What, then, do you
propose?’ he added. I told him they must be copied. He then asked me
if I would undertake the business, and I replied that I was willing.
He bade me begin at my leisure, saying that he left all to me, and he
ordered that for the money needed day by day Don Arcangelo, at that
time Prior of the monastery, should draw cheques upon his bank which
would be honoured. After beginning the collection, since it was his
will that it should be finished with all speed possible, and money was
not lacking, I soon engaged forty-five copyists, and in twenty-two
months provided two hundred volumes, following the admirable list
furnished by Pope Nicholas V.”<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>Cristofano Landino, Lionardo Aretino (Bruni), whose translations from
the Greek were celebrated for their pure latinity, while his speeches
were compared to those of Pericles, and Carlo Aretino (Marsuppini),
were friends of Cosimo, and members of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span> the Platonic Academy. They
often met in the Badia, and Pico della Mirandola, on whom, says
Poliziano, “nature seems to have showered all her gifts,” passed
some time there in study. In the cell of Ambrogio Traversari in the
convent degl’ Angeli at Fiesole, Cosimo was wont to pass his spare
hours in the company of learned men. He was quick in recognising
talent, and possessed the gift said to belong to royalty of suiting his
conversation to his visitors. Vespasiano tells us that “when giving
audience to a scholar he discoursed concerning letters; in the company
of theologians he showed his acquaintance with theology, a branch of
learning always studied by him with delight. So also with regard to
philosophy. Astrologers found him well versed in their science, for he
somewhat lent faith to astrology, and employed it on certain private
occasions. Musicians in like manner perceived his mastery of music,
wherein he much delighted. The same was true about sculpture and
painting; both of these arts he understood completely, and showed great
favour to all worthy craftsmen. In architecture he was a consummate
judge, for without his opinion and advice no building was begun or
carried to completion.”<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>While spending money in a princely manner on works of art, public
libraries and buildings, Cosimo lived as simply as any other citizen.
Though for twenty-five years he was practically the ruler of Florence,
he remained the merchant, the plain burgher, the agriculturist.
His estates were in good order; he superintended the planting, and
rose early to prune his vines. Gambling he detested; the only game
he played, and that but rarely, was chess. Habitually taciturn,
particularly in his later years, yet he could give witty and even sharp
answers; as when one of his adherents, a loquacious, not very wise man,
who, on being named Podestà of a foreign (<i>i.e.</i> not a Tuscan)
town, asked him for advice. “Dress suitably and talk little,” was
the answer. To another he said there was a weed that ought not to be
watered but allowed to wither, and that weed was envy.</p>

<p>In Cosimo’s letters one sees how well his father’s last words, “Be
careful not to attract public attention,” were obeyed by him. The pity
is that even those who pass their lives poring over manuscripts in the
Florentine archives find the greatest difficulty in deciphering his
handwriting, and there are allusions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span> to passing events or to people
which are impossible to understand, as he uses the <i>gergo</i>, or
slang, of his day, or nicknames, the meaning of which are lost to us.
The date of his marriage with Contessina, daughter of Giovanni de’
Bardi, Count of Vernio, is not recorded, but her eldest son, Piero,
was born in 1416. The little we know of her, chiefly from her letters,
depict her as a good, rather parsimonious housewife and a tender
mother. In 1427 Cosimo was at Ferrara, and she writes:</p>

<p>The following letter was written during the negotiations for peace with
Visconti, Duke of Milan. Florence and Genoa had fared badly in the
war. The former had been defeated over and over again, and the whole
of the Western Riviera had been overrun by the Milanese troops. The
interference of Venice had changed the state of affairs, and the Duke
of Milan was desirous for peace. Averardo de’ Medici with Palla Strozzi
were the ambassadors of Florence, and Cosimo discusses the difficulties
attending the negotiation. The Florentines thought that Venice was too
grasping, as she demanded Bergamo as well as Brescia; but the real
crux of the problem was that the Duke of Milan held tenaciously to his
conquests in the Riviera. Peace was finally concluded on April 28,
1428. The Cardinal di Santa Croce had been appointed by the Pope as
arbiter between the parties. Part of the letter refers to Florentine
internal politics, to which now we have no clue; we also see how these
great Florentines mingled their private mercantile affairs with grave
political matters.</p>

<p>I have not had any letter from you since I wrote. By yours of the 29th
I saw the doubt in your mind seeing the difference in the demand, and
as you say there is reason for suspicion, not so much on account of
the differences as because it is evident the Duke [of Milan] is not
straightforward in this matter, so I wish you to try and discover what
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span> difference is, especially about these affairs at Bergamo and what
they mean, and also those of Valcamonica, which seem to me of small
account unless there is something concealed. As matters stand here,
one would not desire to move for so small a thing, and so I trust
you will do your utmost to prevent a rupture; we shall do the like,
and see whether it is not possible to refer these differences to the
Cardinal [di Santa Croce] like the others. The shame would be great to
fall out just when every one expects peace to be made. Franceschino
of Macerata was here yesterday, and from what I could gather had not
heard what was to be done in this affair; this I tell you for your
guidance, as it seems to me very suspicious, although I think the
Cardinal for his own interest will do all that is possible. About the
wheat business, as I said in my last, do not overburden yourself, else
you will have trouble; as it is, it has been a convenience. Ser P.,
the godfather,<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> of whom there was no mention last time, is now in
a strong position, and godfather and godmother are united. This is,
however, no reason for neglecting to take precautions, and we shall
take them; but as we are agreed about other matters, we do not wish
to draw back on this point alone, and perhaps our companion thinks
the same. Now let God lead us on the right path. As to the affairs
of Bordoni, let 24 florins be sent for the wool to the people of
Lombardy, and send again to those of the Riviera, thus setting all in
order; and directly after Easter the rest shall be sent, so that the
same can be written to the Marquess. I think if this had been done a
month ago, things would be in a better condition than they are now.</p>

<p>Towards Genoa things go on as usual, although I think they are hard
pressed; they have again lost a castle between Genoa and Savona, so
that all the western Riviera is under arms, and there is no doubt that
were we to do what we could do the province would rebel, but it is
better not to put it to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span> the proof. I write no more, as I am pressed
for time. Christ guard you.—In Florence on the 1st day of April 1428.</p>

<p>The letters written by Cosimo de’ Medici to his cousin Averardo de’
Medici, in October and November of 1430 and February of 1431, relate to
the costly and disastrous war waged against Lucca, and require a few
explanatory sentences.</p>

<p>The war was proposed to the Commune of Florence by the impetuous
young leader of the aristocratic party in the city, and Cosimo, who
after the death of his father Giovanni was the recognised head of the
democracy, supported the proposals of his opponent and rival, Rinaldo
degl’ Albizzi. The war was popular. The Florentines believed that they
had secured the acquiescence of the Duke of Milan and of the Pope. All
things seemed to favour them (letter of February). The plan of the
Florentine generals in the field was to starve Lucca into surrender
by seizing on the districts of Camaiore and Pietrasanta, whence the
Lucchesi drew their supplies. The “Ten of the Balìa” or Florentine war
committee countermanded this prudent plan of campaign and their troops
could effect nothing against Lucca. The Lucchesi were hard pressed,
however, and appealed to the Duke of Milan. He permitted Francesco
Sforza to take service under Lucca, and that great general soon reduced
the Florentines to extremities. In their need they resolved to bribe
Sforza, and on receiving 50,000 florins he abandoned the Lucchesi. The
“tyrant” of Lucca, Paolo Guinigi, was overthrown; the city became a
Republic, and sued for peace. But Florence resolved to prosecute the
war, and engaged Count Guido Antonio di Montefeltro, Lord of Urbino,
as their general. Thereupon the Lucchesi again appealed to the Duke
of Milan, who permitted Niccolò Piccinino and his troops to take
service under Lucca. The continual interference of the “Ten” with their
generals in the field resulted in one defeat after another. In these
circumstances Cosimo wrote his October letter. He recognises that the
conduct of the war by Florence had been disastrous; sees, when too late
(for the Milanese troops prevented it), that Lucca ought to have been
starved into surrender; and declares that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span> the only way out of their
difficulties is for Florence to induce Venice to attack Milan from
the north. As the “Ten” from their gross mismanagement of the war had
occurred great opprobrium in the city, and as there was little prospect
of matters improving without aid from Venice, the astute Cosimo advises
that none of his prominent friends shall stand as candidate for
election to the Balìa. The letter of December relates to a proposed
embassy to Venice to urge the great Republic to attack Milan.</p>

<p>The war went on for three years longer, and though we have no more
comments of Cosimo on the matter its course may be indicated. Venice
did at length yield to the prayers of the Tuscan Republic, and this
brought her rival Genoa into the fray. At last all parties were weary
of the strife and desired peace. The Marquesses Ettore of Este and
Lodovico of Saluzzo were named arbiters. The Cardinal di Santa Croce
again worked for harmony. A general peace was concluded on April 26,
1433, and its publication in Florence on May 10th was celebrated with
all manner of popular rejoicings.</p>

<p>In the midst of these wars and intrigues it is pleasant to see the good
Contessina careful only that her boys should be brought up in the old
Florentine fashion and that her husband should be properly clad.</p>

<p>Cosimo evidently continued to “be chary with ink and paper,” at all
events to his wife; as when he was again absent at Ferrara with their
two sons, Contessina corresponded with Giovanni, the youngest, who was
barely fourteen.</p>

<p>I wrote to thee a few days ago, so have but little to say. By a letter
from Ser Alexo I gather you are all well, God be thanked. We are the
same, thanks be to God. I hear that thou desirest to come home and
dost not like the place. Thou shouldest be glad to be there, if only
to be in the bank and to learn something. Besides it is not healthy
here. Therefore, my son, I beg thee not to think of returning until
the plague has ceased, and say the same to Piero. Let me know what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
clothes he has had made as I do not know what he wore when he left,
and he has not asked me to send his coat lined with cloth. It has
been very hot here for several days, and I suppose will have been the
same there; so be careful and keep cool. I do not know why Cosimo
has not told me to send his summer clothes, but I think he intends
to return any day. Do thy best to please him in all things, and see
that he wants for nothing; though they tell me he is quite fat, which
is all that is needful. Commend me to madonna Dina and salute monna
Ginevra and thank them from me; Ser Alano tells me they treat you
both as though you were their brothers. I should also like much to
know whether thou art working in the bank, thou or Piero, and whether
Cosimo makes use of Piero. Mind and write this to me. I add no more.

<p>In the autumn of the same year Cosimo again left Florence, partly on
account of the plague, but probably also on account of the bitter
party strife in the city. He writes to his cousin from Verona and then
from Ostiglia, where he heard the news of the defeat of the Florentine
troops near Lucca.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Cosimo de’ Medici</span> <i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Averardo de’ Medici</span> <i>at

<div class="blockquot">

<p>During the last few days I have written thee several letters; this
morning I received thine of the 18th and with it some letters received
by thee from Florence; I have understood, &amp;c. &amp;c., and reply herewith.</p>

<p>I see thou hast been at Florence and understand thou hast to go there
again; the death of Francesco di Tomaso is a great loss, but if the
plague increases I advise thee not to think of business but of saving
thy life.</p>

<p>The affairs of Lucca do not appear to turn out as we expected, which
displeases me; and the money spent on Count Francesco [Sforza] was
thrown away. Every one laughs at us<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span> because he could not remain on
account of the plague, and only consumed the provisions of the people.
It is clear that all that happened and is happening at Lucca has been
done with the knowledge and by the orders of the Duke [of Milan],
particularly as the principal fortresses are in his hands; it appears
to me therefore that there is no hope of getting them by treaty or by
any way save famine, and I suspect the Duke has known how to grasp
fortune, and his troops being near, has provisioned Pietrasanta. The
war will thus last longer than we wished, and all because we would
not when we could. May God forgive those who are the cause. If some
of the present Signori had not enough sense to be of the Ten of the
Balia, instead of ten they should be made nine ... as I already told
thee. It does not seem to me advisable to be one of the Ten of the
Balia this time, partly to let others have their turn, partly because,
on account of party divisions, I do not think the affairs of our
city can prosper; things will go as they did before or even worse on
account of events in Lombardy, for if the enemy is not attacked from
there, it is useless to expect help from here. I am therefore writing
to the Gonfalonier and to Antonio di Ser Tomaso to beg that neither
Lorenzo<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> nor I should be nominated, and I advise thee to do the
same. There are Messer Niccolò Valori and Luca di Messer Maso who
would do well and be pleased.</p>

<p>In my last I told thee that Lorenzo and the children were going to
Venice, as there are some cases of plague here; now they are gone.
If it continues I suppose we must also leave.... No more at present.

<p>I arrived here late this evening and found thy letter of the 4th
telling me about the affairs of Lucca; right glad was I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span> to get it,
as yesterday on the road to Venice I heard far worse news. God be
thanked. We certainly seem to have shown but little prudence; we will
talk of this when we meet. Our people ought to hear what is said of us
and how little we are esteemed; if we go on thus we shall be treated
like Jews. I just hear that I have been elected ambassador together
with Francesco Tornabuoni, and have understood about future movements.
I was on the point of coming back on account of our own affairs and
also about this nomination, of which I have only now been told, for it
will be most inconvenient if I have to go, on account of our private
affairs and also because I am not properly prepared, being away from
home. I have therefore determined to come back at once and try to be
exonerated. I think our friends will be willing to serve us if thou
bestirrest thyself. Thou writest as though my going was certain, so
perhaps I shall receive orders and have to start without returning
home, which would be most awkward. If it be so tell Bernardo de’
Medici to send me those suits which are at home, for as thou knowest
we are in mourning and I have no clothes with me; also I shall have to
provide myself with attendants and horses, I have but seven, and must
have twelve at least. I write this, not because I have made up my mind
to go, for this journey would be most irksome, but because if it is
absolutely necessary I must go in a manner befitting the honour of the
Commune.... No more. Christ guard thee.—In Ostilia [near Rimini] on

<p>I wrote to thee the other day by Pietro Chaetano, and have had no
letter from thee since. This will be given to thee by Battista of
Verrazano, who was it seems once employed in thy office, and is, I am
told, a worthy man: he asks me to recommend him to thee, and I do so.</p>

<p>About the affairs of Lucca I say nothing, because where thou art thou
wilt hear them sooner than I. There are those who, hoping to see
injury and infamy inflicted on others, would inflict injury and infamy
on the Commune, and try with all their might to bring this about;
which shows an evil nature. Nevertheless I think this enterprise is
generally popular, and seeing things have gone so far as to implicate
the honour of the Commune, every one ought to favour it as much as
possible; and this I am doing here, and advise thee, although I know
there is no need, to act likewise.</p>

<p>Letters have come from the Duke displaying great affection for this
Commune and promising every help in this affair. There are also
letters from our ambassador at Rome, saying that the Pope and all the
Cardinals are of the same mind, so it appears to me that they are
abandoned by all, and if they are wise will submit.</p>

<p>From Lorenzo<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> I have a letter of the 80th, and by what he says
he must now have left Venice for Milan together with Messer Andrea
Contarini. They have hopes of doing good business during this year,
particularly as I understand the Duke is in need. Thou shalt hear as
soon as I know anything.</p>

<p>I hear thou hast had a few cases of plague, which grieves me: here
also in the last two or three days there have been some cases, which
makes one fear it may increase. The loss and damage to the city will
be great. I have been thinking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span> where to go, and as far as I can learn
there are three places, either Arezzo in thy house near Anghiari,
Bologna or Modena, or some distance into the Venetian territory, where
it appears to be perfectly healthy. It does not seem to me wise to
come there [Pisa] or to go near Siena or Perugia, for they are all
suspect, as is the Romagna and the Malatesta district, where also
they are preparing for war. As I said it is a serious matter, and
I should like to have thy advice. No more at present. Christ guard
thee.—February 1430 (1431).<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>In April 1433 the war with Lucca came to an end, leaving things
very much as they were before, and the bitter hatred between Cosimo
de’ Medici and Rinaldo degl’ Albizzi grew in intensity. The nobles
accused Cosimo of using his riches to buy popularity, and he withdrew
almost entirely from public life and retired to Cafaggiuolo, his
fortress-villa in the Mugello. What followed is best told in his own
words, translated from his diary.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>On the election of the new Signory (September 1433) it was rumoured
that during their rule great changes were to be made. News was sent
to me in the Mugello, where I had been for some months in order
to escape from the contests and divisions in the city, that my
presence was necessary. So on the 4th of September I returned, and
on the same day visited the Gonfalonier and the others, as well as
Giovanni dello Scelto who I thought was my friend, and who was under
obligations to me, as were also the others. When I told them what
I had heard, they denied it, and told me to be of good cheer, as
they hoped to leave the city in the same condition as they found it
when their time was up. On the 5th they called a council of eight
citizens, saying they desired their advice on certain matters. They
were Messer Giovanni Guicciardini, Bartolommeo Ridolfi, Ridolfo
Peruzzi, Tommaso di Lapo Corsi, Messer Agnolo <a id="acciaiuoli"></a>Acciaiuoli, Giovanni
di Messer Rinaldo Gianfigliazzi,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span> Messer Rinaldo degl’ Albizzi, and
myself, Cosimo. So although, as has been said, it was reported that a
revolution was imminent, yet, having their assurances and believing
them to be my friends, I did not credit it. On the morning of the
7th, under colour of the said council, they sent for me; and when I
arrived at the Palace I found most of my companions and we talked
together. After some time I was told by order of the Signory to go
upstairs, and by the captain of the infantry I was put into a room
called the Barbaria,<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> and locked in. On hearing this the whole
city rose. During the day a council was held by the citizens who had
been summoned, and the Gonfalonier told them I had been detained for
a good reason, which would be explained another time, and that the
Signory desired no advice on this point, and so dismissed them. And
the Signori banished me to Padua for a year. This decision was at
once made known to my brother Lorenzo, who was in the Mugello, and
to Averardo, my cousin, who was at Pisa. The news was also sent to
Niccolò da Tolentino, captain of the Commune, who was my good friend.
Lorenzo came to Florence that same day, and the Signori sent for him,
but he being warned why they wanted him, left at once, and returned
to Trebbio.<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> Averardo also left Pisa in haste, as they had given
orders to seize him. Had they taken us all three, we should have been
in evil plight. Niccolò da Tolentino, on hearing the news, came to
Lastra with his company, intending to raise the city, so that I might
be released. At the same time, when it was known in the mountains of
the Romagna and in other places, great numbers of foot-soldiers went
to Lorenzo. But the captain and Lorenzo were advised not to make a
disturbance, or evil might befall me, so they desisted. Although this
advice was given by relations and friends, and in all sincerity, yet
it was not good, for had they advanced at once I should have been
free,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span> and he who was the cause of all would have been undone. We
may, however, say that all was for the best, as in the end good came
of it, and more honour to me, as I shall relate hereafter. My friends
being averse, as I have said, to create any disturbance, the captain
returned to his quarters, pretending that he had come for another
reason, and Lorenzo went to Venice with my sons, taking with him
all he could of money and small valuables. And the Signori banished
Lorenzo to Venice for a year, myself to Padua for five years, and
Averardo to Naples for five years. Then on the 9th the bell was rung
for a parliament, and those who had been the cause of all assembled
on the Piazza with much infantry. Twenty-three citizens were also
summoned, verily a small number, and but few of the people were
present, because in truth the mass of the citizens were ill-pleased.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>If I thought that this my misfortune and terrible ruin might serve
to bring peace to this blessed people, not only would exile be
acceptable, but I should even welcome death, if I were sure that my
descendants, O Signori, might pride themselves on my having been the
cause of the wished-for union of your Republic. As you have decided
that I am to go to Padua, I declare that I am content to go, and to
stay wherever you command, not only in the Trevisian State, but should
you send me to live amongst the Arabs, or any other people alien to
our customs, I would go most willingly; and if your Lordships command
me to discover the origin of the ill, as a beloved son is bound to
obey his father’s wishes and a good servant the orders of his master,
so would I obey you for the peace of your people. One thing I beg
of you, O Signori, that seeing you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span> intend to preserve my life, you
take care that it should not be taken by wicked citizens, and thus
you be put to shame. I do not so much fear the pain of death as the
abominable infamy of undeserved assassination, for a violent death
is the manifest sign and outcome of a bad life, and I have not led
the life of a villain, but of an honest and good merchant. Even if
I have not been faultless, I have always tried to merit the love of
good men, because my actions were good. As, however, disaster comes to
me by your orders, I accept it as a boon, and as a benefit to me and
to my belongings. Have a care, O Signori, that those should not have
their way who are in the Piazza with arms in their hands and anxiously
desire my blood, without regard for my innocence. My pain would be
small, because such a death being over in a short time cannot be very
painful or hard to bear; nothing is so brief as death. But you would
earn perpetual infamy by having made me a promise which was broken
by villainous citizens: infamy is worse than an innocent death. If
I go to the Trevisian State, I leave my heart and my soul with you,
and shall only be happy when I can do something for the good of your
people, as I pray you and every good citizen to do. Every trouble will
be easy to bear as long as I know that my adversity will bring peace
and happiness to the city. I know, and this is no small comfort to me,
that I never permitted wrong to be done to any one. I never frequented
the Palace<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> save when I was summoned; I never roused hatred of
the Republic amongst your subalterns, because I never ill-treated
them; I always declined to be nominated an official, which is often
prejudicial to the body and hurtful to the soul; with no small pride
I affirm that none can say my ill-behaviour ever caused a city to
rebel or to be taken from you; on the contrary, our money bought
several: ask your soldiers how many times they were paid by me for the
Commune with my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span> own money, to be returned to me when convenient to
the Commune. Never have I been found wanting when the Commune could be
enlarged, and although I am exiled, I shall ever be ready at the call
of this people. In conclusion, O Signori, I pray God to keep you in
his grace and in happiness in this fortunate Republic, and to give me
patience to bear my unhappy life.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Balìa was given by the parliament to certain citizens and I was
banished to Padua for ten years, Lorenzo to Venice for five, Averardo
to Naples for ten, Orlando de’ Medici to Ancona for ten years,
and Giovanni di Andrea di Messer Alamanno and Bernardo d’Alamanno
de’ Medici to Rimini. My branch of the family were created Grandi
(<i>i.e.</i> incapable of holding any magisterial office), with
the exception of the sons of Messer Vieri, and the sons of Antonio
di Giovenco de’ Medici, because Bernardetto was much beloved by
the Captain of War, and in deference to the Captain, Averardo and
his brothers were passed over. We were more rigorously dealt with,
particularly in that I was forbidden to sell any possessions or to
touch my money in the Monte, and I was kept in the Palace until the
3rd day of October.</p>

<p>When this was known in Venice three ambassadors were sent here, who
left no means untried to procure my liberation, offering to keep me
in Venice, and promising that I would do nothing against the Signory,
and would obey all orders. Though they could not obtain my freedom
yet their advent was most useful, for there were those who desired
my death, and they secured a promise that no harm should be done to
my person. In like manner the Marquess of Ferrara sent orders to the
Captain of the Balìa, who was Messer Lodovico del Ronco of Modena, a
subject of his, that if I were put in his hands he was to treat me as
though I were Messer Lionardo his son, and that if he fled with me he
was to fear nothing.</p>

<p>They kept me, as has been said, until the 3rd of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span> October for two
reasons; first, to obtain permission from the Balìa to rule the city
according to their pleasure, threatening to kill me if it was not
given; thus those of my friends and relations who were in the Balìa
were fain to agree to all they wished. Secondly, they thought to
ruin us by preventing me from making use of what was mine. But in
this they failed, for we lost no credit, and many foreign merchants
and gentlemen offered to us, and even sent to Venice, large sums of
money. Finding at length that their plan of making us bankrupt did
not succeed, Bernardo Guadagni (the Gonfalonier), being offered money
by two persons, 500 florins by the Captain of War, and 500 by the
treasurer of S. Maria Nuova, which were paid him in cash, and Mariotto
Balduinetto being offered 800 florins by Baccio d’Antonio di Baccio,
they took me out of the Palace and accompanied me beyond the Porta
S. Gallo. They had small intelligence, for they might have had ten
thousand or more for allowing me to escape from peril.</p>

<p>On the 4th October I arrived at Cutigliano in the mountains of
Pistoja, being accompanied by two of the Eight of the guard. The
mountaineers presented to me wax and grain as though I had been an
ambassador. On the 5th I left and arrived at Fassano in the territory
of the Marquess of Ferrara, accompanied by more than twenty of the
mountaineers. On the 6th I reached Modena, and the governor met me on
behalf of his lord, presented gifts, and next morning went with me as
companion and guide. On the 7th I was at Bondeno and next day went by
water to Francolino, where I waited two days for Antonio Uguccione de’
Contrari, who made me many offers of service from the Marquess. On the
11th I arrived at Venice, being met by many gentlemen, our friends,
together with Lorenzo. I was received like an ambassador, not like an
exile. Next morning I visited the Signori to thank them for all they
had done for my welfare, saying that I owed my life to them. I was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
received with more honour and affection than I can describe; they
pitied my sufferings and offered the Signoria, the city, and their
treasure for my needs, and a house. Many gentlemen visited me and
brought me gifts. On the 13th I left for Padua according to command,
and Messer Jacopo Donato went with me and lodged me in his fine
house, furnished with linen, beds, and eatables fit for the greatest
personage, and he remained with me until I returned to Venice about
the 20th. At Padua, by order of the Signoria of Venice, they offered
to place at my disposal anything I wanted. I have recorded these
honours that were paid to me in order not to seem ungrateful by not
mentioning them, and also because it is incredible that, banished from
home, I should yet be treated with so much honour; for generally one
loses one’s friends with one’s fortune. Lorenzo was informed with what
honour I had been treated by some merchants, and also by a servant of
the Signoria who came to Padua with me, and who had been ordered not
to speak about it.</p>

<p>Bartolommeo de’ Ridolfi being Gonfalonier of Justice, I asked leave of
the Signori to be allowed to live at Padua, Venice, or elsewhere, in
the Venetian territory, and the permission was given, but with orders
not to approach within 140 miles of Florence. This was done to please
the Signoria of Venice who, through their ambassador, Messer Andrea
Donato, asked it. It is true that severe penalties were attached to
the grace, as can be seen in the document.</p>
</div>

<p>After giving the names of the new Gonfalonier and Priors (who were
elected every two months), Cosimo continues:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The people and all good citizens being discontented, Antonio di Ser
Tommaso Nasi came to me at Venice and begged me to draw nigh to
Florence, offering to escort us home in case we were attacked. Also
many of our relations and friends wrote to us. We thought it better to
first ascertain the intentions of the Signori, and replied we would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
do nothing against their wishes. For this we sent Antonio Martelli
from Venice to learn what they wished. From him we got the good news
that we were to come. On receiving the letter Lorenzo and I, Cosimo,
left on the 29th of September; Averardo, being ill of fever, remained
in Venice. On the 30th we reached Ponte a Lago and lodged in the
house of the Magnificent Uguccione who, together with the Marquess,
had collected at our request a large body of foot-soldiers in the
mountains of Modena and Frigano, together with 200 horsemen he had
in his pay, to accompany us as had been previously arranged. On the
1st October, while we were at mass, a courier arrived from Antonio
Salutati with letters stating that the intentions of the Signori
having become known in the city, and our arrival being expected, our
enemies, that is to say Messer Rinaldo degl’ Albizzi, Ridolfo Peruzzi,
and others had taken up arms on the 26th to the number of 600. But
their heart failed them towards evening, and being persuaded by
Messer Giovanni Vitelleschi, then Bishop of Recanati, and afterwards
Archbishop of Florence and a Cardinal, who was my good friend, they
went to S. Maria Novella, where dwelt the Pope.<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> Hearing that our
friends were well provided with arms and with men, and being in fear
for their lives, Messer Rinaldo, Ormanno his son, and Ridolfo Peruzzi
remained there that night, and their companions dispersed and put away
their arms. The Signori summoned a large force of infantry to come
into the city, while from the Mugello, the Alps, and Romagna more
than 3000 men came to our house. Niccolò da Tolentino was called with
his company, and on the 29th, the day of S. Michael, a parliament was
held on the Piazza, at which the people assisted fully armed. Their
number was great, and good order was kept. Balìa was given to ...
citizens and they annulled all that had been ordained the year before.
First they decided that Cosimo and Lorenzo should be reinstated in
their former positions—there were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span> not four contrary votes—so we
were pressed to come home with all speed. Having read the letter, we
at once sent it to Venice, where it caused much rejoicing, and we
then went to visit the Marquess, who showed even more pleasure than
ourselves. After thanking him for all the favours he had shown us
we left Ferrara on the 2nd and got to Modena next day. The Governor
and the Podestà came out to meet us with many citizens, and we were
received most honourably in the Marquess’s house. All our journey
was at his expense, and everywhere we found men-at-arms who had been
ordered to accompany us; but there being no need for them we dismissed
them. On the 5th we reached Cutigliano and then Pistoja; and exactly
at the expiration of a year, on the very same day, <i>i.e.</i> the
5th October, we again set foot in the Commune at exactly the same
place. I record this because when we were banished some well-affected
and kindly persons told us that before the year was out we should be
recalled, and once more find ourselves in Florence. Many citizens came
out to meet us on the road, and at Pistoja the whole population was at
the gate to see us pass fully armed, for we would not enter the town.
On the 6th we arrived at our own house, Careggi, to dinner, and found
much people. The Signori sent to tell us not to enter the city until
they told us, and this we did. At sunset they sent to bid us come and
we set forth with a great following. But as the road we were expected
to take was crowded with men and women, Lorenzo and I with one servant
and a mace-bearer of the Commune rode round the walls. Going behind
the Servi, and then behind S. Reparata and the Palazzo del Podestà,
we entered the Palazzo de’ Signori without being seen, as every one
was in Via Larga, waiting for us near our house. The reason why the
Signori did not wish us to enter by daylight was lest we should be the
cause of an uproar in the city. By the Signori we were received most
graciously. We thanked them with fitting words, and they insisted on
our remaining in the Palace with them and some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span> other citizens. We did
so. We found that before we arrived Messer Rinaldo and Ormanno his
son, Ridolfo Peruzzi, and many other citizens had been banished. The
city was quiet, though the people were always in the Piazza, and in
the Palace were many armed men for security.</p>
</div>

<p>Cosimo gives the names of the Signory for November and December and
continues:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>They banished many citizens and set down (<i>i.e.</i> made
<i>Grandi</i> or nobles) many disloyal families and did many things
favourable to the city. During their rule the Balìa given to various
citizens expired, the Squittini, or Scrutinies, came to an end, and
the borse, or ballot-bags, remained for five years in the hands of
the Accopiatori, that is to say, the borse of the Priors, so that
they could make whomsoever they would Priors and Gonfaloniers of
Justice. In January my name was the first to be drawn from the borse
as Gonfalonier, and in my time no one was banished nor was ill done
to any one. I caused the sentence of death passed upon Francesco
Guadagni, and upon some others whom I found in the hands of the
Captain of the Balìa, to be commuted to perpetual imprisonment. Also
I ordered the armed men who stood at the door of the Palace to be
removed and the Palace and the Piazza to be kept as they were before
the revolution, and I prolonged the league with the Signory of Venice
for ten years.</p>
</div>

<p>“Seldom has a citizen returning triumphant from a victory,” writes
Machiavelli, “been received by such a concourse of people and with such
demonstrations of affection as was Cosimo on his return from exile,
saluted by all as the benefactor of the people and the father of his
country.”<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>It was probably while at Venice that Cosimo bought the slave girl
by whom he had a son, Carlo, who was brought up for the Church and
recognised as belonging to the family. He inherited his father’s
tastes, and was employed by him and by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span> Piero to buy books,
manuscripts, statues, &amp;c., in Rome. He became a Canon of the cathedral
in Florence and Arciprete at Prato, where he died. The number of female
slaves imported into Florence in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries
was a most disturbing element in family life and the cause of much
jealousy, as can be gathered from the novelists of the time. Nearly
all came from Caffa (Theodosia in the Crimea) and from the mouth of
the Tana. Caffa must have been practically a Genoese settlement, as
the Genoese consul levied a tax on every slave that passed through the
town, and they were many. Hundreds of Circassian, Tartar, Armenian,
Georgian, Arab, Turkish, Russian, and Greek girls were shipped, chiefly
to Genoa and to Venice, where the trade had existed since the eighth
century. In Florence the duty paid on every slave that entered the city
must have brought in a considerable sum to the Commune, as owners were
obliged to register every newly-acquired slave within two months and to
have him or her baptized, if the rite had not been already performed.
One would have thought that good Catholics might have had some qualms
of conscience about keeping a Christian as a slave, but Sacchetti
writes:</p>

<p>“May a slave being born a pagan who becomes a Christian be sold? I say
yes. None may be free who do not believe that Christ will come again.
Even though I buy a slave who is then baptized, he or she is baptized
as a servant and a subject and is like unto one in prison, who cannot
give a bond or go bail, and most of them go to baptism like oxen.
Baptism does not make them Christians, and no one is obliged to set
them free even if they be Christians unless they wish. I do not say
that if you perceive them to be good, and that they desire to be good
Christians, you should not set them free, but you would commit a sin if
your slave is like most, even if he or she be a Christian, to set them
free, for you take the stick from off their backs and give them full
scope to do every sort of evil.”<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>The saintly Archbishop Antonino is of the same opinion as the novelist.
He declares that baptism does not free a person from slavery, <i>quia
servitus introducta est etiam de jure divino et per jus gentium et jus
canonicum approbata</i>.</p>

<p>By a law of 1366 the flight of a slave was declared a serious offence;
any one aiding or inciting a slave to run away was fined 200 florins
(piccoli), half to go to the Commune, half to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span> the owner. The seduction
of a slave was still more severely punished, and the seducer was held
responsible for her price if she died in childbirth. If the father was
a free man the child was also free, and the father was bound to provide
for it.</p>

<p>From 1366 to 1397, 259 Tartars, 27 Greeks (from Constantinople or from
Rhodes), 7 Turks, 3 Slavonians, 3 Circassians, 2 Bosnians, 1 Arab, 1
Saracen, and 1 Candiote, nearly all girls from nine to twenty-four
years of age, and 26 little boys or lads, are carefully described in
the register. They cannot have been handsome, as many were marked with
small-pox, others had scars (<i>margines</i>) which were probably
tribal marks.<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>They were sold either <i>sub jugo perpetue servitutis</i>, or for a
certain number of years. Thus Rucellai bought a slave for eight years,
but finding that she was with child he sent her back to her former
owner; many were bought, or rather hired, for two or three years as
wet-nurses. Baldovinetti in his <i>Ricordi</i> or Memoirs notes: “On
May 7, 1376, I bought a slave for thirty-five florins from Bartolommeo
of Venice, named Tiratea, or Dorothea, a Tartar from Russia. She was
about eighteen years of age, and Cieci the broker only put twenty-five
florins into the bill of sale on account of the duty. With brokerage
and duty she cost me one florin, and four florins for clothes, as she
was almost naked when I bought her. I sold her in September 1379 for
thirty-six florins.</p>

<p>“In 1380 I bought on November 28th a slave for forty-five florins, her
name is Domenica, she is fair-skinned and comes from near Tartary. I
bought her of Bartolommeo of Venice, who in writing declares her to be
sound in all ways. With brokerage and other expenses she cost me before
I got her home eleven golden florins, and as she was almost naked,
altogether forty-seven florins.”<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p>In the fifteenth century prices rose, as the Florentines insisted on
having Russian or Circassian girls as being better-looking. Their
reputation for honesty and morality did not stand high, and they were
often brutally ill-treated and imprisoned in the dreaded prison of
the Stinche for stealing, &amp;c. Alessandra Strozzi, writing to her son
Filippo at Naples in 1465, warns him about two he thought of buying.</p>

<p>“Thou tellest me in thy letter of the 28th that a slave is offered
thee who was here with Lionardo Vernacci and that thou wouldest have
taken her but for the old one thou hast in the house. I must tell
thee that she is not fit for thee according to my ideas. Lionardo’s
wife had her four or five years, and as she did not learn and was of
a bad disposition they feared she might do some ill to herself or to
others, so they got rid of her; she was also dishonest. They sold her
to Antonio della Luna, with whom she remained but a short time, as
he would not have her and sent her back; so she was sent down there
[Naples]. Lionardo’s wife had her for sewing, but she had no aptitude
for it. Had she been a good servant they would have kept her for
themselves. Thou sayest thou hast one now who belonged to Filippo degl’
Albizzi; she was highly thought of and well treated, but was sold
because wine began to affect her and made her extremely lively, and
also she was immoral. Having a wife and children in the house he would
not keep her. She is praised for loyalty and intelligence. Now do as
thou wilt.... I have told thee what I know.”<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p>Towards the end of the fifteenth century the manumission of slaves
begins to be mentioned in wills together with bequests to hospitals and
convents. By the word <i>este civis romana</i> the slave became a free
man or woman, could own property, buy and sell, and act in all other
respects as if free-born.<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>The letter of Lorenzo de’ Medici and those of Francesco Sforza to
Cosimo relate to a second war with Lucca, and need some explanation.
The recall of Cosimo from exile, as told in his diary, was followed
by a wholesale banishment of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span> enemies from Florence, and left him
practically master of the Republic. The exiled Florentines naturally
desired to return, and according to the custom of the time were eager
to invoke foreign aid. The times for long offered no opportunity. But
in 1436 Genoa at last shook off the yoke of the Duke of Milan and
became a republic. The sister republics of Florence and Venice at
once allied themselves with the new free State, and Filippo Visconti
believed himself to be seriously threatened by the new league. He had
at the same time lost the services of one of his two great generals.
Francesco Sforza, determined to acquire a principality for himself,
had seized part of the Marches which nominally belonged to the Popes.
In these circumstances the Duke of Milan resolved to attack Florence,
the one of the allies which lay nearest to him. While the Florentines
engaged mercenary troops (Taliano, or Tagliano, mentioned in the
letters, being one of the leaders of small bands) and named Sforza
the General of the Republic—a very untrustworthy general, as events
proved. In the war which ensued Lucca was attacked by the Florentines
and defended by the troops of Milan. In 1438 Florence was twice
threatened by Visconti’s army, then in the territory of Lucca. The
second time they were led by the famous condottiere Niccolò Piccinino,
and Francesco Sforza had orders to oppose him and if possible to seize
Lucca. The attempt failed, partly because Sforza, always hoping to
obtain the hand of Madonna Bianca, Visconti’s illegitimate daughter,
did not wish to offend him by fighting against his troops, partly
because Venice, jealous of the possible acquisition of Lucca by
Florence, laid claim to his services and refused to pay her share of
his stipend unless her commands were obeyed. Cosimo went to Venice
“thinking,” writes Machiavelli, “to be able to persuade her. To the
Senate he pointed out the condition of Italy, the power of the Duke of
Milan, his reputation and the number of his troops, and concluded by
saying that if the Count (Sforza) went over to him they would together
command the sea, and the liberty of Venice would be endangered. To this
the Venetians replied that they well knew their own power and the power
of the Italians, and believed they could defend themselves. Adding that
they were not in the habit of recompensing soldiers for serving others,
and that the Florentines, having made use of the Count, might pay him
themselves. They considered it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span> more necessary for the safety of their
State to lower his pride than to give him money; and the ambition of
men being unlimited, if he were paid now without serving them, he would
eventually advance far more dishonest and dangerous demands. Thus it
seemed to them desirable to curb his insolence before it became too
great. But if out of fear, or for any other reason, the Florentines
desired to retain his friendship, they were at liberty to pay him. Thus
Cosimo returned without concluding anything.”<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p>Cosimo never forgave the Venetians for traversing his plans, and the
enmity between the two Republics began from that day.</p>

<p><i>Spectabilis collega noster carissime</i>,—Yesterday I wrote to
thee by Messer Alexio. Since then we have nought from thee. Now we
write because having turned over in our own minds this affair of
Taliano and consulted with other citizens about it, it seems to us
that it would be an excellent thing for the State of Count Francesco
and for the League if some arrangement could be come to between His
Holiness the Pope and the aforesaid Count as to the Marches, as thou
art aware was once proposed. We therefore tell thee to employ every
possible means to achieve this, which would be a most excellent thing,
and as soon as thou canst learn aught about the intention of the Holy
Father let us know, because until we hear from thee we shall not
communicate with the Count.</p>

<p>To-day we have received a letter from our ambassadors to the Count, of
which we enclose a copy. It appears to us a new departure, of which
we know nothing, which we do not understand, nor can we judge how the
Signoria of Venice will take it when they hear. Think over it well,
and if it seems good to thee to tell them or to take any other steps,
do so, only make them understand perfectly that we have nothing to do
with this affair, which is quite outside our intentions, and above
all declare that it is our desire to live in perfect brotherhood and
friendship with that Signoria, and thus to cause the Count to keep on
good terms with them. If this letter finds thee at Ferrara, and thou
thinkest well to send or to write to Venice about this business, or
if thou thinkest better neither to send or to write, do as it seemeth
best to thee, for we place complete trust in thy well-known prudence.

<p><i>Spectabilis ac Magnifice vir tanquam pater carissime</i>,—I have
read your letter and see you suspect that Niccolò Piccinino is not
following the course traced by the Illustrious Duke of Milan, and you
beg me to come to a good understanding with Niccolò, lest danger to
the Magnificent Commune of Florence and to myself should ensue. As
to the said Niccolò, I cannot believe he would act thus. First, on
account of the great honours he has received and is receiving from the
Illustrious Lord Duke, who only now has with great pomp declared him
Marquess and Count of the house of Visconti with the right of bearing
their arms. Secondly, because being of a certain age and with so great
a reputation in the past, I do not believe that he would run the risk
of being reviled in the present. Also he must know that he cannot
swallow the world, and that it might happen to him as it does to oxen
when they leave their stables in the morning, who think they are going
to pasture, but are put to the plough; to him also the contrary might
happen to what he expected. Thirdly, as you know, he has published
everywhere a letter declaring his allegiance to the Duke of Milan.</p>

<p>As to your advice about being good friends with him, I think you
say well; and by the copies of my letters to Niccolò, which Lorenzo
must have sent you, you will see whether it is my fault or his that
this has not succeeded. It is true, and I declare to you, that I do
not intend to lose my honour or my possessions for the sake of his
friendship, and it would be a strange thing if in order to gain the
friendship of the said Niccolò, I, who have always transacted and
settled all disputes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span> between the Duke and myself, and those arising
from them, should be the first to lose what is mine, and what has
been gained by my own exertions. I am certain that even should I wish
to give away my possessions, or to make any sort of compromise which
would indicate a doubt as to my ownership, you, whom I regard as a
father, would not allow it, seeing how my reputation would suffer.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>To conclude, I have agreed with the Duke of Milan and have the
agreement in my house, which I quite believe he will observe. In the
document there is no mention, either for good or for evil, of Niccolò
Piccinino, so I have nothing to do with him, and am much astonished
at the things he demands of me. Now either he does this with the
knowledge and consent of the Duke or not. If with the Duke’s consent
it is done with the intent that this affair should go on and that
your Signoria should break the promises and contracts with me, which
I do not believe; if done without the Duke’s knowledge it is most
probable he will take another course. In so doing he would give us
every right to oppose him, and he might in many cases be a loser, in
one among others which would bring infinite loss and ignominy upon
him, that is his Company, for eight out of ten of the men have wives
or children, so that what would happen I know not, and do not see that
Niccolò would gain either profit or honour. My opinion, which I have
not breathed to man alive, is that the Duke has consented to Niccolò
putting forward these demands, not seeing how to refuse him permission
to make them, but not with the intention that we should come to blows.
And you will see that Niccolò will eventually follow the course traced
out by the Duke, and that all these intrigues and demonstrations, and
loud talk, wherein Niccolò shows such valour, are rather scarecrows
to frighten people; but scarecrows are good for frightening kites and
such-like birds of prey, I do not heed them, being the son of a Sforza
and not of a kite. Let what will happen, as long<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span> as none can say that
I have been the cause of any troubles. I am not; and I believe I shall
be held guiltless by God and by the world. But whoso tries to take
from me what is mine will find it far harder and more thorny than to
demand it, as at present. I have replied to the Marquess, so there is
no more to say.—Given in my Camp near Arezzo, 28th May 1438.<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<p><i>Magnifice tanquam Pater carissime</i>,—I have received your
letter in cipher and have understood what you say about the affairs
of Florence, Venice, and Macerata; I need say no more, because Messer
Rinaldo will inform you of everything. I thank you for the news
about Lombardy. I had heard something of the sort here, and that the
Venetian troops were as though they did not exist, so little are they
esteemed by those of the Duke of Milan. The arrival of the person sent
by the magnificent Signoria of Florence will be most welcome to me,
the sooner he comes the better I shall be pleased.</p>

<p>Piero Gian Paolo [Orsini] passed through here and sent to tell me
that if I wished he would join me, as he is disengaged, and says he
has been badly treated with regard to money, and also that others no
better than himself, such as Tagliano and Luigi del Verme, have been
set above him and have received more honours, so nothing will induce
him to remain there, which may be useful. It would be good in every
respect to have him, but you know what are my expenses, so that I
cannot alone undertake to engage him. Therefore I wish the Signoria
of Florence would do so at the rate of 8 ducats a month and 1 for
commission, whereas the Signoria pays 12 for each man. I pray you let
me know quickly as to the intentions of the Signoria, so that I may
know what to do. Until I have your reply I shall keep the affair in
suspense,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span> although I am not sure whether he really means what he says
or not. If he does, the thing may be arranged; if he does not, it will
fall of itself, and at any rate we may discover why he came here. For
it is better to be forewarned and on one’s guard against the craft
of others. I have no more to say save that I am advancing into the
Marches and shall be near there.—<i>Paratus ad omnia</i>, 11th August

<p><i>Magnifice tanquam Pater carissime</i>,—The honourable Alamano is
going to inform the Signoria exactly how things are, and from him you
will have ample information. And as I think you will discuss whether
it will be better to side with the Signoria of Venice as has been
suggested, or with Niccolò Piccinino, as you will see in the despatch
brought by the said Alamano, I hereby give you my opinion. Seeing that
the Signoria of Venice are up to their throats in water, and that
their State is half ruined, and that now, when the need is great, they
do nothing; and also considering that to remedy this state of things
they will need much time, and will delay when quickness is necessary;
and also considering that the Signoria of Florence, yourself,
and others, were always advised to ally yourselves with the said
Piccinino, I conceive that it is far more dangerous to steer a middle
course than to side with one or the other. For these reasons it is far
better to side with Niccolò Piccinino, particularly as the Duke of
Milan has several times advised me to do so, and has just written me
duplicate instructions, saying he will never give me Madonna Bianca,
or anything else I desire from him, unless I am in perfect accord with
and make an alliance with Niccolò Piccinino. This can be done to avoid
all trouble. So I send<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span> Battista my secretary with my conclusions for
you to see, and have taken time enough to answer for the reply to come
from Florence; for whatever you decide is to be done, will be well
done. In case you do not agree, take the course that seems best to
that Magnificent Commune, only let me know; for what I once said I say
again, that my wishes are those of that Magnificent Commune. Only I
wanted to give my opinion. If the Magnificent Commune and you decide
for Niccolò Piccinino, you can tell Battista to write at once without
referring to me, and to follow his instructions, because the Commune
is contented with what I have done. Despatch the courier to Mantua,
for he knows that road, and in case he has not passed through let him
wait. But if the alliance with Niccolò Piccinino does not please you
do not write there, but to me here as quickly as possible. In any
case negotiations with Venice must be kept open, and if you write to
Battista be so good as to tell me at once, so that I may know how
things go.—Given in our Camp, 22nd August 1438.</p>

For hadst thou asked for it before I should have sent it as I did the
other. It appears to me you have all decided<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span> not to return to Careggi

but he has not. So I send thee a pair of his oldest hose which button
on to the shoes. Tell the bearer who it was that sent thee those
new shoes which do not fit, and he will inform Francesco Martelli

<p>The two following documents relate to the celebrated Council of the
Church which met at Florence during Cosimo’s second term of office as
Gonfalonier, or chief magistrate. The Œcumenical Council of Basel had
actually come into conflict with Pope Eugenius, in the end deposed him,
and declared the papal chair vacant. Whereupon Eugenius ordered the
Council to transfer its sittings to Ferrara, excommunicated all its
members who refused to obey and packed the assembly with his adherents.
But a pestilence broke out at Ferrara, and proposals were made to bring
the assembled ecclesiastics to Florence. The citizens were eagerly
excited, for both the Patriarch and the Emperor of Constantinople
were expected to attend. The Pope arrived in Florence on January 2nd,
1439-40, the Patriarch on the 12th, and the Emperor John Palæologus
on the 15th February (the entry of the latter is represented in the
fresco in the chapel of the Riccardi palace),<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span> and were all sumptuously
lodged. The essential findings of this Council are important, for they
were reproduced in the Canons of Trent. It was supposed to unite the
Greek and Latin Churches, but its real result was to introduce the
Italians to ancient Greek literature, and, if such things can be dated,
it marks the beginning of the Italian Renaissance.</p>

<p>Cosimo’s brother Lorenzo de’ Medici was sent to Ferrara in December
1438 to arrange with the Pope about transferring the Œcumenic Council
to Florence. The instructions given by the Signory are curious and show
how burdensome the Councils were to the cities in which they were held.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Commissio Laurentii de’ Medicis</span>, <i>3 Decembris 1438</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Thou art to go to Ferrara and present thyself at the feet of H.H.
Pope Eugenius, commending to him our city, and this Signoria and our
whole people, as faithful and devout sons of Holy Church and of His
Holiness, offering our city and our people to His Holiness.</p>

<p>To descend now to substantial matters; thou wilt say that this
Signoria has heard that His Holiness is inclined to come to Florence
with his Court, and the Greeks, and the other members of the Council
gathered together there. Having heard this the Signoria send thee to
H.H. to devoutly offer our city as the residence and the abode of H.H.
and his Court and the others above mentioned; being moved thereto, as
in all matters, by their special devotion towards H.H.</p>

<p>Should His Sanctity ask anything special for the Greeks thou wilt
answer that we shall willingly provide houses for them gratis,
without demanding any rent, and that we shall strive to render the
houses suitable for their various degrees of nobility. If money for
the maintenance of the Greeks is mentioned, which we hear amounts to
1500 florins a month, thou art to say that our Commune is very short
of money on account of the long war, &amp;c., and for this reason our
Commune would be most grateful not to be burdened, but nevertheless
if absolutely necessary we are ready to lend H.H. the said amount of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
1500 florins, or of ducats, every month, on receipt of a promise and
valid security as to repayment at a given date, to be agreed upon by
both parties. For as the Greeks come on business of the Church, it is
only reasonable that the Church should pay and bear the burden. It is
enough if we advance the money every month, which will only be repaid
after some time. Otherwise it would seem as though we had bought his
visit, which would not be at all to the honour of our Commune, and we
are certain His Sanctity does not desire us to do anything which would
be dishonourable to our Commune.</p>

<p>We consent to begin the payment of 1500 florins, or ducats, per month,
from the day the Greeks leave Ferrara, and to continue it while they
are in Florence, but not for more than eight months.</p>

<p>If agreements and conventions for the Court are mentioned, such as
taxes on houses, jurisdiction, immunity from excise duties in and out
of the town and such things, and houses for the Lord Cardinals, &amp;c.,
thou art to say we are ready to concede everything that is reasonable
and just, and that the last time H.H. was at Florence with his Court,
agreements and conventions were made, and the same thing can be done
now. When H.H. is here we can settle, and add or correct whatever is
reasonable on one side and the other.</p>
</div>


<p><i>Additio facta Commissioni Laurentii de’ Medicis</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Lorenzo, thou seest the commissions we have given thee in the full
instructions. Strive to carry them out. But if the Pope insists
on having money for the expenses of the Greeks without giving any
security or promise to repay, reduce the various amounts as much as
possible, so as not to exceed 1500 ducats a month, or at the utmost
1700; to begin when the Court arrives here, or, that being impossible,
when they leave Ferrara, and then only promise money for eight months
and no longer.</p>

<p>If the Pope will not consent to the agreements about his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span> Court
mentioned in thy instructions being drawn up here, ask what he
demands, and look at the conventions conceded to him when he was here
last, and act upon those within certain limits, for some of them need
revision. The necessary changes have been noted at the end of each
article.</p>

<p>The Signoria think the Pope ought gladly to promise and to give
security for the repayment of the money used for the expenses of the
Greeks; reason and justice demand this, therefore do thy best in this
matter, so shalt thou reap honour and the Republic benefit by thy
intelligence and industry. Should the Pope ask for any security for
his own person or that of others, see that thou understandest clearly
the nature of such security and write to us here; we will then do what
His Sanctity wishes.<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<p><i>Magnifice vir et tanquam Pater honorandissime</i>,—If I have
erred in writing my humble opinion to Your Magnificence, I beg you
will not attribute it to presumption, but rather to my fidelity,
and to affection for the State of our Lord the Pope and for your
Commune. I do not deal in occult secrets, but speak of what I have
seen in the past while weighing present events, which are by no means
clear. Believe me, Cosimo, my motives are not dictated by passion,
because I am the devoted and faithful servant of our Holy Father, of
Holy Church, and especially of Monsignore the Florentine Cardinal,
therefore I think the present opposition of His Reverence to the Lord
of Foligno is, <i>sententia mea</i>, not only untimely but dangerous
to the State of His Holiness and may be also to yours. I do not say
this to excuse the errors of the said Lord, indeed if it were of any
use I would blame him, but to try and ward off imminent danger. You
know the position of Foligno, her Lord can do much damage with even
a small number of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span> men. The Perugians are suspicious, and suspicion
is a malady one cannot doctor, so that a great disaster and much
trouble may arise in the land, and it is ill fighting with desperate
men. Believe me that other lords and communes are as suspicious as
the Perugians, each one is intent on guarding his own State, and
the discords of parties here are not good for the State of our Holy
Father, for Holy Church, or for your Commune. It seems to me that for
the common good Monsignore the Cardinal should rather attend to the
conquest of Romagna; he could do nothing more useful, it would cut the
passage of the Ducal troops, and it is no longer a good frontier for
the League or for you gentlemen of Florence. If ever the possession
of Romagna was necessary it is so now, considering the action of the
Council towards His Sanctity; although from what I hear it will not
lead to much, still it unsettles the minds of the people, and Italy
is altogether in a disturbed condition, as you see. The establishment
of Romagna as a barrier would be a great boon to the State of His
Holiness, to the Church, and to yourselves; if we do not strike when
we can, when we wish to do so it will be too late. Remember that the
last time we fell out with the Lord of Foligno he obtained help from
troops in Romagna; had they been in Lombardy they would not have
come, indeed they could not. I pass over many things which it would
be difficult to answer, but I beg of you, Cosimo, to think over this,
which touches your Republic very closely, and of all the troubles
which are brewing or which may brew from the Alps downwards; do your
best to find a remedy, and you will be the author of peace and quiet
in all Tuscany. You may rest assured, Cosimo, that I write in all
sincerity and truth, without subterfuge, if you will believe me. Not
only my small faculties but my life is at the service of our Holy
Father and of Holy Church, and also at that of your Commune. One thing
I will not conceal, and that is that I suspect this enterprise of
Foligno is distasteful to the Illustrious Count, and having entered
with such goodwill and liberality into the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span> affair, great caution must
be used not to do anything he would dislike. I write all this not
with the desire of pleasing or of displeasing any one, but to satisfy

<p><span class="smcap">Most dear Son</span>,—The reason I write is that this morning at
table Cosimo told me that Maestro Mariotto had gone to spend eight
days with thee, and said that when Maestro M. returns he will let me
come to be with thee, so I pray thee to ask him to remain with thee
as long as thou art there, as I think thou hast need of him, and also
Cosimo is well pleased that he should remain, and bids thee arrange
so that he may be content. Let me know, for if he comes away nothing
shall prevent my coming, for on no account will I permit thee to be
there without him or me, so tell me his intentions. Had I known when
he left I would have saved him the trouble and come myself. Tell me
whether thou hadst rain on the day of thy departure, and if thou hast
need of anything write to me. I say no more. Christ protect thee.—In

<p>The condition of this city thou must have heard from others, so I
shall be brief. There are many splendid palaces, houses, tombs, and
temples, and other edifices in infinite number, but all are in ruins;
much porphyry and marble from ancient buildings, and every day these
marbles are destroyed by being burnt for lime in scandalous fashion.
What is modern is poor stuff, that is to say the buildings; the beauty
of Rome lies in what is in ruin. The men of the present day, who call
themselves Romans, are very different in bearing and in conduct from
the ancient inhabitants. <i>Breviter loquendo</i>, they all look like
cowherds. Their women are generally handsome in face; all the rest is
uncommonly dirty; the reason, they tell me, is that they all cook.
They seem agreeable, but one seldom sees them. Amusements there are
none, save to go to these pardons (indulgences) which are perpetual,
and in these days of Lent the women frequent them, as well as those
who, like me, have nothing else to do.</p>

<p>The following is the first letter from Lucrezia, the devoted wife
of Piero de’ Medici (the Gouty). She was the daughter of Cosimo de’
Medici’s intimate friend, Francesco Tornabuoni, and must have been a
remarkable woman. Cosimo had a high opinion of her ability; after his
death in 1464 her husband consulted her on all political questions, and
when she was absent kept her minutely informed about passing events.
She corresponded with many of the literary men of her time, was no mean
poetess, and many of her sacred plays and lauds were very popular.
Niccolò Valori praises her rare eloquence and her translations from
Holy Writ into the vulgar tongue. She was also an excellent housewife,
and by her tact, goodness, and kindly manners did much to preserve the
pre-eminence of the Medici. The education of her children occupied her
greatly, and few princes of that day were brought up like Lorenzo and
Giuliano. Lucrezia’s deep religious feeling was tempered by a joyous,
merry nature, which comes out in her letters, and accounts for the
affection she inspired in so many and such different people. It is
strange that no authentic portrait of her is known. One cannot help
thinking she must be depicted in Ghirlandajo’s fresco in the choir of
S. Maria Novella representing the life of S. John the Baptist, which
she narrated in her poem <i>La Vita di San Giovanni Battista</i>.
The more so that the fresco was commissioned by her brother Giovanni
Tornabuoni, and contains many portraits of his family and of friends
and dependants of the Medici. It is true it was painted a few years
after her death, still her image cannot have faded so rapidly from
recollection.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord and Master mine</span>,—Yesterday I had a letter from thee

all thou sayest in thy letter and whatever Maestro Giovanni orders;
nothing will seem fatiguing or irksome to me for regaining my health,
which I believe by the grace of God will improve, so I think you will
all be well pleased.</p>

<p>I see thou hast purged thyself and art going to the villa, of which I
am glad; be careful to keep well and do not give way to melancholy,
for I shall return cured and do honour to Maestro Giovanni, to whom I
show much attention, for he deserves it.</p>

<p>If thy coming here can be done without fatigue and with pleasure
to thyself it would be a great joy to me, but if troublesome and
fatiguing to thee, do not come. I am glad Bianca Maria has recovered;
how I pray to God that she may continue well as thou, I, and her
husband desire, I leave thee to imagine. To Mona Nanna and to Filippo
I have given greetings and they commend themselves to thee and to all;
commend me to Cosimo, to Mona Contessina, Mona Ginevra, and Giovanni,
and salute Pier Francesco and kiss Bianca Maria from me. Christ guard

as soon as thou canst. Thou knowest how anxious Cosimo and I are about
thy stay in Rome; thy brother also is anxious. Had Cosimo known that
plague was there he would never have let thee go. Cosimo has perpetual
fever as he had when thou didst leave him, and these doctors call
gout fever, and have done so for some time as thou knowest, and one
can never be sure what may happen from one day to another. Therefore
I beseech thee to return as quickly as thou canst, for thou art well
aware how much he has to do. More I will not write to-day. Piero and

<p>With my own hand I wrote thee a letter on the 21st: since then I
have had two letters from thee announcing thy safe arrival, and that
thou art trying to obtain the indulgences in order to come away. I
advise thee to do so with all possible speed, for although thou sayest
that the death of the Bishop of Volterra has not changed matters,
other letters I have seen declare the contrary; a prolonged stay is
therefore not advisable.</p>

<p>The affectionate manner in which our Holy Father received thee, and
what thou sayest as to the love he bears us, is most grateful to me. I
see by his reply that thou hast told him what I said, that we are not
idle and will do all we can to persuade them to follow the counsels
of His Holiness. But it will be difficult, because if either party
thinks to gain anything he will not abide by the agreement. What the
Venetians want and what the Count wants is of such importance to them
that nothing else will be regarded as of any moment. We have sent
Messer A. and are leaving no means untried to reconcile them, as we
know how important it is to our city.</p>

<p>Messer Agniolo Simonetto and Messer N. Arimboldi sent to the King by
the Count with powers to sign the compact will have arrived; I know
not what is thought of it there, but we shall soon hear the truth.</p>

<p>From Lombardy letters have come from the Count of the 19th, dated
from Vimercato. He reports that with his whole force he is there and
at Melzi and Casciano and other places near by, and that Milan is
so surrounded that no supplies can enter. The Venetian troops are
encamped in the positions he held at first, and one sees that both
armies are suffering much discomfort. Any attempt to revictual Milan
must be made by ascending from the heights into the plain and passing
by the places held by the Count, when there would be fighting. They
say Milan is in dire straits. Other news there are none, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span> we
know not what is said there. Innocenzio Cotta has taken the town and
fortress of S. Calombano for the Count, which it seems is a place of
importance. Nothing more is said about our peace with the King, and to
my sorrow there is a coolness about sending ambassadors. Pray God it
may be for the best.</p>

<p>I see Messer Giovanni di Nerone is to have the bishopric of Volterra;
I hope he may do well. If Messer Carlo<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> gets the Parish Church<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>
I do not mind. I did not wish to ask for the canonry of Messer
Giovanni which is in the gift of the Consuls, as many citizens wanted
it. With this I send thee a letter from Messer Giovanni Migliorati
received to-day. Thou wilt see what he writes. If this be true, and
it can be had for Messer Carlo, it would be well. If thou thinkest it
might be of use, speak to His Holiness about it and try to obtain a
conditional promise, I would then let thee know at once if the event
occurs: for our Holy Father shows us such affection that it seems to
me unwise not to ask if one can get anything. No more at present.

<p>In the name of God on the 18th day of December 1450.</p>

<p>Yesterday I had a letter from thee. The things thou wantest shall
all be sent by the first man going to Volterra. Cosimo continues to
improve; he has not been very ill this time, although the fever has
not yet left him, but it is slight. Thy shoes were ready, but they
have made them black, so others must be made, and I will send them
by the first messenger. We have not yet heard of the arrival of our
party, but one who met them on the road says they were well:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span> as soon
as I hear I will let thee know. Although I told thee we paid too much
for the pigs, I want thee to send us a pig or a roe for Christmas,
if they are offered to thee; if we have to buy them we will not have
them. Messer Rosello writes that he is coming to pass Christmas with
me, and has sent Cosimo a fine cloak of Polish fashion of marten and
sable, a pair of gloves, and the tooth of a fish a foot and a half
long. As we have to prepare for the festival of the Three Kings, they
will make a little change from my cloth of gold.</p>

<p>The plague affects us but little. For three days out of four during
the week no one mentions it, they are all people one does not know. I
should be so glad to know how thou art, and whether thou art better or
worse since thy departure. Thy return, when it takes place, will be a
great joy to me.</p>

<p>Antonio degl’ Strozzi has been to see me, and pestered me much about
that business: he wants to come here for Christmas, tell him what
thou thinkest; and so be he says that I promised him anything do not
believe it, for he could learn nothing from me: so be cautious how
thou dealest with him.</p>

<p>Tell the women I do not write because there is a dearth of writers
until Mateo returns from Rome, he ought to be here to-morrow. Salute
them from me, and say many things, and caress the children and kiss
them for love of me; if the women want anything I can send, tell me.
No more at present. God guard thee.</p>

he wants. Here the plague has ceased, and I am glad thou art coming
back; although it might be well to stay a little longer and see how
thy health goes, but thou canst always return there if necessary.
Tell me thy decision. I wrote the day before yesterday to ask thee to
search in the cupboard in my room there for a pair of scissors which
belong to Cosimo and to bring them, or they can be put into the strong
box. No more to-day. Salute Pier Francesco from me, and tell him he is

<p>When, after the death of Visconti, Francesco Sforza had attained the
object of his ambition and become Duke of Milan in 1450, Cosimo sent
his eldest son Piero with Neri Capponi, Luca Pitti, and Diotisalvi
Neroni, to salute the new duke. “They proceeded in triumph,” writes
Cambi, “through the Milanese territory, and all their expenses were
paid. The number of horsemen was so great when they arrived within five
miles of Milan that it seemed like a manœuvring ground. Then the Duke
in person advanced to meet them, and embraced and kissed them. Never
was greater honour paid to Florentine ambassadors.”<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>

<p>Piero de’ Medici was also one of the citizens deputed to meet the
Emperor Frederick III. on his entry into Florence in January 1451. He
dismounted at the church of S. Gallo, which had been magnificently
decorated with hangings of cloth of gold and silk. In his train was
the poor boy-King of Hungary, Bandilagho, as Cambi writes Ladislaus,
and many German princes and bishops, whose outlandish names are quite
beyond the old chronicler’s powers of spelling. “The Emperor seated
himself,” continues Cambi, “on a most splendid chair under the loggia
of the church, and all the gentlemen stood round him while the Ten
of the Balìa bent the knee before him on either side, representing
the Magnificent Signori. Messer Carlo d’Arezzo made a speech, to
which Monsignore Enea, Bishop of Siena [the celebrated Æneas Sylvius,
afterwards Pope Pius II.], replied in the name of the Emperor. Then the
Emperor mounted again, and the Ten of the Balìa took the bridle of his
horse, and in that manner they proceeded to the fore-port of the Porta
S. Gallo where the Magnificent Signori of Florence awaited him seated.
The Colleges had a fine banner with the Emperor’s arms, and when he
came under it the Signori rose and went to his bridle, which the Ten
abandoned. Mariotto Benvenuti, the Gonfalonier of Justice, took the
right side and Rosso Ridolfi took the left, the other Signori with all
the citizens following them, and thus they accompanied the Emperor to
S. Maria Novella where the Pope’s apartments had been prepared for him.
The magistrates were on foot, and the others who had gone out to meet
him were on horseback. It was, indeed, a splendid sight.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span> Please God he
may recognise it, and be grateful for such honours which have been so
costly.”<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></p>

<p>After the sack of Constantinople in 1453 Florence became the
headquarters of Greek men of learning. For fifteen years John
Argyropoulos “poured forth wisdom from his golden mouth,” and Demetrius
Chalcondyles, Johannes Andronicus Calistus, Constantius and Johannes
Lascari succeeded him. They gave a fresh impetus to the study of
Platonic philosophy as opposed to that of Aristotle; even the children
of the chief citizens spoke Greek with such case and purity that
Poliziano exclaims, “Athens has not been destroyed by the barbarians
but has migrated to Florence.” It was then that Cosimo determined to
found the celebrated Platonic Academy, and selected Marsilio Ficino,
the son of his physician, to preside over it, although he was little
more than a boy.</p>

<p>The sack of Lodi gave Cosimo’s opponents an opportunity to interfere
in home politics. Their first step in June 1454, on the pretext that
war was over, was to abolish the Balìa, which they imagined was the
mainstay of his authority. This, of course, was useless as long as
the Scrutiny made by the Balìa and the Accopiatori appointed by them
were still in office. In November, therefore, a new Scrutiny was made,
and in January 1455 the new Signory ordered that in six months’ time
the power of the Accopiatori should cease, and the Gonfalonier and
the Priors be once more chosen by lot. The measure was a popular one,
and it worked, not against Cosimo, but against Luca Pitti, Diotisalvi
Neroni, and Agnolo Acciaiuoli, as it put an end to their power of
manipulating the appointments to office. The disturbed condition
of Italy after the death of Pope Nicholas the peace-lover, and the
discharge by the Venetians of Jacopo Piccinino, whose standard became
the rallying-point for all discontented and dissatisfied men, reacted
upon Florence. A feeling of unrest was abroad. Many citizens considered
the Government weak and vacillating, and were only waiting for the
election of a Signory who shared their views to make an attempt to
“reform” the city. But without the consent of Neri Capponi this was
impossible. So things remained as they were until his death in 1457
left Cosimo with a free hand. The re-assessment of the <i>catasto</i>
early in 1458 was a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span> heavy blow to his opponents, the new register
of property entailing upon them considerable loss. In their dismay
they turned to Cosimo, and suggested the creation of a new Balìa, a
new Scrutiny, and fresh Accopiatori, but he refused to listen to any
proposal for the renewal of the Balìa save in the usual way through
the Colleges and the Councils. When Luca Pitti became Gonfalonier of
Justice in 1458 he tried in vain to induce the Council to appoint a new
Balìa, and Girolamo Machiavelli, a hot-headed republican who declared
against all Balìe as inimical to the freedom of the citizens, was
arrested and tortured with others who shared his views. Luca Pitti made
the most of this so-called conspiracy, and tried to set his authority
against that of Cosimo. Losing patience, Cosimo said to him: “You
strive towards the indefinite, I towards the definite. You plant your
ladder in the air, I place mine on the earth so that I may not climb
so high as to fall. It seems to me but just and natural that I should
desire the honour and reputation of my house to surpass yours. Let
us therefore do like two big dogs which sniff one at the other when
they meet, and then, both having teeth, separate and go their ways;
you to attend to your concerns, I to look after mine own.” Cosimo
then summoned a parliament. His position can be gauged by the advice
given to Duke Sforza by his Ambassador to Florence: “When you would
have one thing done rather than another, write your opinion or your
desire privately to Cosimo, and he will always arrange it for you.
Do not waste your time in saying, I would have their opinion, &amp;c....
Popular governments are alien to and diverse from others, and Cosimo
cannot be for ever in the Palace as he once was.” Pope Pius II. also
declared, “Nothing is denied to Cosimo. He is the arbiter of peace and
of war, and the moderator of the laws. Not so much a private citizen
as the lord of the country. The policy of the Republic is discussed in
his house; he it is who gives commands to the magistrates. Nought of
royalty is wanting to him save the name and the state of a king.”</p>

to Giuliano. Lorenzo is learning the verses his master there gave

<p>The entry into Florence of Galeazzo Maria, Count of Pavia, son of
Francesco Sforza, Duke of Milan, is described in a curious poem written
in 1459 by an unknown author.<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> Leaving Cafaggiuolo, where the lad
slept, he entered Florence on 17th April 1459, and dismounted at the
Medici palace. Next day Messer Galeazzo visited the Signoria, who made
him sit in their midst and offered him their services. “I thank you for
your greeting,” answered the young Count, “and beg you to command me
and to dispose of all I possess. For you I will abandon any enterprise,
and serve you against any power.” Then with a prayer to God to grant
them happiness and long lives the lad of fifteen added: “I beg you to
pardon my youth if, from want of knowledge, I have not spoken aright
in your presence;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span> remember I am but a boy. I commend you to Christ
our Lord.” From his letters to his father we get a glimpse of the home
life of Cosimo. He writes that even the ladies of the family helped to
entertain him, and he was charmed with the playing of one of Piero’s
daughters on the “organo di cave.” At a dinner at Careggi he notes
that Giovanni, Cosimo’s second son, did not sit at table, but acted as
a kind of steward, and saw that every one was properly served. After
dinner a poet improvised verses in honour of the guest. “Certes, Lucian
or Dante could have done no better,” he remarks. Then they danced,
Piero’s wife Lucrezia Tornabuoni, Giovanni’s Maria Ginevra degl’
Alessandri, and a daughter of the Strozzi, held to be the handsomest
maiden in Florence, and some peasant girls.</p>

<p>Two days later came Pope Pius II. on his way to the Congress he had
summoned at Mantua to arrange for another crusade. He was received
with great honour, and young Sforza made an oration, kneeling in the
dust before the Pope. Then Pius seated himself on a gestatory chair
and was borne into the city on the shoulders of the lords of Faenza,
Rimini, Carpi, and Forli, instead of riding on a mule, which was the
usual practice. “This,” observes Cambi, “was a proof of pride, not of
holiness.” The old chronicler then describes a tournament in the Piazza
S. Croce “for the temporal lords, but many ecclesiastics also went. And
on 29th April there was a ball in the Mercato Nuovo, which was enclosed
with a stockade surrounded by seats covered with tapestry. Sixty young
Florentine gentlemen, who were expert dancers, richly adorned with
pearls and jewels, and many pretty maidens and girls who were good
dancers, danced; and they changed their dresses several times. All the
ambassadors were there and some of the cardinals, and it was calculated
that in the seats, in the houses round, and on foot, there were more
than 60,000 persons. There was also a great hunt in the Piazza de’
Signori, which was closed all round with a stockade, and inside were
turned loose two lions, two horses, four bulls, two young buffaloes,
a cow and a calf, a wild boar, a giraffe, with twenty men and a large
ball of wood, so made that a man could stand upright inside and roll
it about in order to exasperate the animals. But the loud shouts of
the people so frightened the lions that they were as though stupefied,
many men broke into the enclosure and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span> lions were as lambs among
them. The preparations had been great, and the expense large, but the
pleasure given was small.”<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p>

<p>The last few years of Cosimo’s life were clouded by ill-health and
suffering, and the knowledge that the growing arrogance and rapacity
of his party, the Palleschi, were to a great extent alienating the
affection and the esteem of the citizens from his house. Then the death
in 1461 of Cosimino, the only child of Giovanni and Ginevra de’ Medici,
was a bitter grief to his grandparents, whose especial pet the little
boy had been. Two years later Giovanni himself died, and the old man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
sadly exclaimed that the palace in Via Larga was now far too large for
so small a family. He had always counted on the help Giovanni would
give to his elder brother Piero, who was crippled with gout, and his
death at the early age of forty-six was a blow from which Cosimo never
rallied.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Pope Pius II.</span> <i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Cosimo de’ Medici</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Beloved Son</span>,—Peace and apostolic blessing. The news we have
just received of the death of your son, Giovanni of blessed memory,
has grieved us deeply, not only because it is in itself untimely, but
also because we fear it is likely to prove hurtful to a man of your
age and infirmity. Yours is a life that should be prolonged in the
sweetness of the Spirit, and you ought at all times to find comfort.
Our own consolation is that you are wise, that you are well versed in
the chances of fortune and able to hold your feelings in restraint. We
urge you then, Cosimo, to do this, and looking towards God, to bless
Him and to trust that all is for the best. We are ignorant of His
secrets; He alone knows our needs and our true advantage. Let us then
have faith that we and your son have been dealt with in gentleness,
for neither you nor he could foresee the future. We look to your lofty
nature, my son, to continue bearing God’s will in this with patience,
even as we hear you do bear it, without giving way to grief. Mourning
accords not with your age; it is contrary to your health, and we
ourselves, your native city, and all Italy, require that your life
should be as far as possible prolonged. Let good works and acts of
piety be your tribute to your son’s memory. Anything else would be
inconsistent with your nature; deeds of charity, devotion, and prayer
are their own reward. This brief letter is written to acquaint you
with our grief, and to assure you of our solicitude. Let these few
words be counted for our affection.—Given at S. Peter’s, in Rome,
under the ring of the Fisherman, on the 1st day of November 1463, in
the 6th year of our pontificate.<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Most blessed Father</span>,—The power and wisdom of the words
you wrote made me feel, while I read them, that I was veritably
listening to the consoling voice of Him whose true Vicar you are.
Nothing more sweet, nothing more saintly, or even divine, could have
been written. And your consolation had this effect: I have always
thought it expedient and praiseworthy to control (for I could not
quench) my grief; but now, most blessed Father, to act contrary to
your advice would seem to me positively sinful. I therefore strive to
the best of my power, and so far as my weak spirit will permit, to
bear this great calamity with calmness. To me it appeared a calamity;
but God alone knows what is truly a misfortune, and we, as you write
so wisely and devoutly, are ignorant of it. Yet I never thought it
was not well with my son Giovanni, for I remembered that he had gone
forth, not from life, but into life from death. For this, which we
call life, is death, and that is the true life which is everlasting.
And I recognised that the only suffering his death brought with it
was ours, who truly must needs miss him. Yet we know not for what to
pray. I trust that God in the abundance of His mercy will pity us
that are left behind; for the Lord is gentle and full of mercy. But
for my own life, I count it happy, because the Supreme Pontiff, the
Vicar of Christ, has been thoughtful on its account. I will indeed
take care of it; but not for the reasons which you, in your more than
human kindness, have put forward. For what is my power now worth? What
worth has it ever had? Nay, my purpose in caring for my life is that
I may be found not to have despised this precious gift of God, nor
to have forgotten the mercies which I have received from the divine
love. I ask of you, most blessed Father, that your Holiness offer a
prayer for me, your son, to God, that I may have strength to achieve
this.—[1463].<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a></p>

<p>On 3rd November 1463 Pius II. wrote again to Cosimo, to ask him to
induce Florence to aid him, by equipping two galleys for his projected
crusade against the Turks. Cosimo’s answer is most respectful and very
wary.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Cosimo de’ Medici</span> <i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Pius II.</span></p>


<div class="blockquot">

<p>Cosimo greets the Supreme Pontiff.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Most blessed Father</span>,—I received your Holiness’ letter a few
days ago, a letter full of grandeur and dignity, whose wisdom, as no
one can doubt, could have proceeded from none but your Holiness. Me,
at any rate, it so affected that after reading it several times I
became convinced that such speech was beyond the common use of men,
and was indeed none other than what might seem to be written at the
dictation of that truly divine Spirit which spoke in the saints of
old. When you speak of the insecurity of man’s lot, who would not
straightway be moved by the power of your eloquence to despise all
that is human? And when you solemnly tell of our immortal life to
come, can any be so dull and leaden that he would not feel exalted, as
he reads, so as to gain a vision, even here, of the glory of his own
immortality and be inspired by a wonderful longing to attain it? And
your deeds are no less holy than your words. I say nothing of what you
have achieved in the past, saintly though it is and worthy of sacred
remembrance. But with regard to the enterprise which you are now
preparing, is it possible, most blessed Father, to believe that you,
who are Christ’s Vicar, are attempting it without the presence within
you of Him whose representative you are? The task is one so novel and
so marvellous, that without God’s impulse and support to your age and
infirmity the undertaking would seem doomed to fail. That I suppose is
the reason why some people regard it, as you say in your letter, with
amazement and disapproval. But I ask you, most blessed Father, whether
it is not indeed a matter for wonder that a man like you, whose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
years and feeble health make their own claim to a life of ease and
repose, should embark on the exertions of travel and all the hardships
of war. It is natural, then, that the well-wishers of the Christian
Commonwealth, the friends of peace in Italy, and all who desire the
true and righteous tranquillity of kingdoms and the permanence of
the Christian sway, should behold these difficulties and dangers
with dread. They look upon your virtue as a gift clearly sent by God
for the healing of human ills; they love the Roman Church and care
for the integrity and happiness of Christendom; and they regard your
safety as their security for all these. It must needs be that they are
alarmed by your undertaking such difficulties and your exposure to
such dangers, seeing that they do not possess your wisdom nor are they
supported by the divine breath which inspires you. But though they do
not see that which is before the eyes of your greater wisdom, perhaps
since they wish only for what may be best for you and most beneficial
for your flock, they do not deserve so much blame for disapproving
an enterprise which to their limited apprehension appears so great
and so difficult. You, most blessed Father, whom God will guide to
victory even as He has brought you thus far, will persevere in spite
of it all. Nor will the faith of Peter whose seat you occupy fail you.
The end of this undertaking, which you begin so splendidly, will be
to the glory of God and the joy and felicity of all that are yours,
even though its initial stage be difficult and laborious. Behold the
faithful shepherd offers his life for his sheep.</p>

<p>I now come to the summons which you address to me and the invitation
to join you in this beneficent and glorious enterprise. There you
write to me not as a private man who is satisfied with the mediocre
dignity of a citizen, but as though I were a reigning prince, and your
exhortation is so kind that I find myself unable to thank you as I
would wish. For though all through my life God’s kindness and bounty
has showered upon me much more of human goods than I ever deserved,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
whereof you most eloquently adduce examples, yet by the grace of Him
who is the giver of all that is good, I have never been oblivious of
my humble lot. You, however, most blessed Father, in your superhuman
kindness write to me in terms of moderation and in the form of a
request, whereas it would be your right to urge, nay to command.</p>

<p>But the things you ask of me, most blessed Father, are not of the same
nature; as to the first, to procure you a vote of assistance from our
city, well you know how limited is the power of a private citizen in
a free state under popular government. Nevertheless I am ready to
exert my influence, such as it is, in this direction, and will do so
to the best of my ability, even as I have done hitherto; I will try to
arrange that your interests should be consulted, for your interests
are ours and those of the common cause of all Christians. This city
of ours has never yet remained behind in any glorious undertaking;
but has often by her own choice taken upon herself enormous expenses,
difficulties, and dangers, for the defence and dignity of the Roman
Pontiff. Therefore I do not believe that she will now hold aloof when
you summon her to take part in this enterprise which is pious and
necessary and to the common interest of us all.</p>

<p>Personally, from my own resources I can promise you something more
definite; that is to say I promise you, not indeed to equip two
galleys (which would be an undertaking for a prince not for a private
man), but to assist you so far as the limitations of my resources
permit. I am not the man to imagine that the gifts of fortune which
I possess are the deserved rewards of my business forethought, or of
any virtue on my part, or that I have gained them by my human work
or my industry, no, I am convinced they are but the gifts of a most
bountiful God. If God, who is Himself the giver of all good things,
either now or at any other time claims any part of it back, I should
deserve to be deemed most ungrateful and impious if I grudged to
return what He gave ungrudgingly;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span> but especially now, when such a
reward is promised me, which he, who in truth can loose and bind, puts
before me.</p>

<p>Be bold therefore, most blessed Father, in the cause of Christendom,
persevere with energy and confidence, and bring the matter to an end.
Be convinced, since God inspires you, that opportune assistance will
not be wanting. And at last, when you have scattered the barbarous
foes of the Christian name, when your sheep are defended and their
fold protected, not only will mankind ever remember to honour in you

<p>Lucrezia was as anxious about the physical well-being of her children
as about their education. Some months before Cosimo died she was at
Pisa with Giuliano, who was ill, and she writes to her husband:</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Lucrezia de’ Medici</span> <i>to her husband</i> <span class="smcap">Piero</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I write thee several letters on the same day so that should one go
astray thou wilt have news of Giuliano as thou desirest, by any one
going there. Yesterday I wrote that as he was better I did not think
the change suggested by Messer Mariotti was necessary, and last night
I told thee the fever had returned as usual. My last letter was
written at seven. After that he did not rest so quietly as on other
nights, and he seems to me more uneasy than he should be now that the
fever has diminished. I wish thee to know every small change so that
thou canst the better judge what Maestro Mariotto writes; and act, not
according to my ideas, but as thou thinkest best after reading our
reports. His pulse is good, all functions are natural. The fever has
returned almost as strong as on the fourteenth day,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span> and has lowered
but little. He is not so lively during the day as I could wish, being
weakened by the strength of the fever. The Maestro says this is caused
by the nature of the phlegm which is in him. I wish thee to know this.</p>

<p>But do not be anxious, for Giuliano is strong; he walks about the
room, and, though pale, is of good complexion. I give thee all these
details more for thy information than because Giuliano seems to me
ill, or that the amelioration does not continue. I commend myself to
thee.—The 24th November 1463 at the 16th hour.</p>

<p>At this moment Giuliano is awake, and the Maestro says he has never
found him so free from fever, and that during convalescence people are
always more uneasy. Dost thou understand?<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></p>

<p>Yesterday we received yours of the 19th, by which we see you are all
well. This is most pleasing to us, also that the town is healthy and
that you are taking good care of Giuliano who is well. Again we beg of
you to see that he takes care of himself. We have also received the
letters from Bruges and all my other letters which you had, all shall
be answered.</p>

<p>I note that you will write to Niccolò in a few days, when the farm
of Piero da Gagliano will be taken over. The sooner this is done the
better, as the creditors have begun to get restless, that is Giovanni
Rucie ...<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> to whom I have notified that he is to stop proceedings,

cold weather with snow and ice in these last days has put an end to
it, so for the present we are all well. Day<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span> by day you shall have
news how things go. Yester evening it began to rain, and is much
milder.</p>

<p>By the grace of God Contessina and I are very well, and so are Bianca
and Gugliemo and the little Contessina. They come to us often to
keep us company. To-morrow morning we shall get a letter from the
Signori here to the Consuls [of the Sea]<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> at Pisa, in order that
you may cut the wood for the galleys that are to be built. This is a
favourable moon for felling trees.</p>

<p>Ruberto is dangerously ill, there is small hope of his recovery. God
help him. For this reason none of his brothers can go to help about
the wood for the galleys.</p>

<p>The following document shows that Francesco Sforza realised how much he
owed to Cosimo de’ Medici. When on the death of Filippo Maria Visconti
in 1447 Milan declared herself a Republic, popular feeling in Florence
ran high in her favour. It needed all Cosimo’s authority and influence
to induce his fellow-citizens to assist Sforza in seizing supreme
power. Cosimo saw that as a republic Milan would inevitably fall a prey
to Venice, and thus the communications of Italy with the North would
be cut off. A strong ruler who owed his crown to Florence would be an
invaluable ally, and preserve the balance of power in Italy. We shall
see that Piero faithfully carried out his father’s policy.</p>

<p>As we have always felt a particular affection for the magnificent
Cosimo de’ Medici of Florence on account of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span> singular virtues, and
as he also has loved us and all that pertains to us, we are bound and
obliged to love all that belongs to him. Now here in Milan Pigello
Portinaro, a Florentine citizen and merchant, the administrator and
partner in the business and bank of the Magnificent Cosimo de’ Medici
and of Piero and Johanni his sons in Milan, who has served us and the
illustrious Madonna Bianca our consort ever since he came to inhabit
this our city, about eleven years ago, with very large sums of money,
with stuffs and with jewels, and with loans of divers kinds as appear
by the entries in our private books. These services, subsidies, and
favours given by the said Pigello according to the orders of the
aforesaid Magnificent Cosimo and his sons were most pleasing and
acceptable to us because they were given willingly, and the said
Pigello carried them out and fulfilled them with great diligence,
loyalty, and love towards us, and with admirable discretion, by which
means we were enabled to arrange our affairs. Pigello made every
effort to do this with the smallest possible loss to us, and we are
sure he will continue to do so. Therefore we are much pleased and
have been well served by the aforesaid Pigello; and all the profit,
lucre, and gain that the said Pigello has made, either in their name
or in his own with us and with our stewards, officials, and any other
agents of ours, we for the above-named reasons approve of and are well
content. By this our letter we declare that they can have and hold all
without fear of contradiction or qualms of conscience, releasing and
absolving the said Magnificent Cosimo, his sons and the said Pigello,
and their sons and heirs in perpetuity from any claims; promising
for ourselves, our sons and successors, that no question shall be
raised about any profits or gains they may have made with us up to
the present day for the above said reasons, or for any depending or
arising therefrom. Because as has been said we have already, and by
this our letter we do now make a general donation of the aforesaid
privileges which is formal and binding, and is to be understood as
including all those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span> clauses and formalities which are necessary in a
full and valid donation <i>de jure</i>; with the reservation that if
any error is discovered in the books, writing, or reasons above said,
they are to be corrected and amended in honest and just fashion; and
this is to be understood as binding upon both parties. We command all
our governors, clerks of the exchequer, and all other our officials
and subjects who see the present letter, to observe it implicitly
without contradiction or exception. And that all who see this letter
may know that it is written by our own orders, we have signed it with
our own hand, and had it sealed with the seal we always use.—Given in
Milan on the 11th day of March 1463 (1464).</p>

<p>The last months of Cosimo’s life were passed chiefly at Careggi, and
his great solace was in study, as the following letter shows:</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Cosimo de’ Medici</span> <i>to the</i> <span class="smcap">Reverend Master Marsilio
Ficino</span>, <i>Platonist</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Yesterday I came to the villa of Careggi, not to cultivate my fields
but my soul. Come to us, Marsilio, as soon as possible. Bring with
thee our Plato’s book <i>De Summo Bono</i>. This, I suppose, you have
already translated from the Greek language into Latin as you promised.
I desire nothing so much as to know the best road to happiness.
Farewell, and do not come without the Orphean lyre.</p>
</div>

<p>About twenty days before his death, whilst talking to Ficino, Cosimo
bewailed the unhappy lot of humanity and exulted in the happier
prospect he felt was opening out before him. Ficino replied by citing
corresponding ideas from Greek<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span> authors, particularly from Zenocrates,
upon which Cosimo demanded of Ficino, as a last service, to translate
his treatise on Death into Latin. The end was fast approaching, and
Cosimo’s calm, rather ironical nature was not changed by physical
suffering or by the fear of death. When his wife asked him why he
remained silent for so many hours at a time, he answered: “When we go
to the villa the preparations for our departure occupy thee for fifteen
days; dost thou not understand that I, who am leaving this life for the
next one, have much to think on?”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>A few days before Cosimo died Piero wrote to his two sons Lorenzo and
Giuliano at Cafaggiuolo, where they had been sent with their mother,
Lucrezia, on account of the plague which had broken out in Florence.
Indeed there was a report that Cosimo’s malady was the plague, and many
were afraid to visit him.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Piero de’ Medici</span> <i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Lorenzo</span> <i>and</i>
<span class="smcap">Giuliano</span> <i>his sons at Cafaggiuolo</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I wrote to you the day before yesterday how much worse Cosimo was.
It appears to me that he is gradually sinking, and he thinks so
himself. On Tuesday evening he would have no one in his room save Mona
Contessina and myself. He began to recount all his past life, then he
touched upon the government of the city and then on its commerce, and
at last he spoke of the management of the private possessions of our
family and of what concerns you two; taking comfort that you had good
wits and bidding me educate you well so that you might be of help to
me. Two things he deplored. First, that he had not done as much as he
wished or could have accomplished; secondly, that he left me in such
poor health and with much irksome business. Then he said he would make
no will, not having made one whilst Giovanni was alive, seeing that
we were always united in true love, amity, and esteem,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span> and when it
pleased God to so order it he desired to be buried without pomp or
show, and reminded me of his often expressed desire to be buried in S.
Lorenzo. All this he said with much method and prudence, and with a
courage that was marvellous to behold, adding that his life had been
a long one and that he was ready and content to depart whensoever it
pleased God. Yester morn he left his bed and caused himself to be
carefully dressed. The Priors of S. Marco, of S. Lorenzo, and of the
Badia of Fiesole were present. He made his confession to the Prior of
S. Lorenzo and then heard mass, and he spoke the responses as though
in perfect health. Then being asked the articles of faith he repeated
them word by word and made his confession and took the Holy Sacrament
with more devotion than can be described, having first asked pardon of
all present. These things have raised my courage and my hope in the
Almighty, although according to the flesh I am sorrowful, yet seeing
the greatness of his soul and how well disposed he is, I am in part
content that his end should be thus. Yesterday he was pretty well, and
also during the night, but on account of his great age I have small
hope of his recovery. Cause prayers to be said for him by the friars
of Il Bosco<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> and bestow alms as seems best to you, praying God to
leave him with us for a while, if such be for the best. And you, who
are young, take example and assume your share of care and trouble as
God has ordained, and being boys, make up your minds to be men; your
condition and the present case demanding that of you lads. Above all
take heed to everything that can add to your honour and be of use to
you, because the time has come when it is necessary that you should
rely on yourselves. Live in the fear of God and trust that all will
go well. Of what befalls Cosimo I will advise you. We are expecting a
doctor from Milan, but I have more hope in Almighty God than in aught
else. No more at present.—Careggi, the 26th July 1464.<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a></p>

<p>The following letter is undated, but as it refers chiefly to the
character of Cosimo de’ Medici, and to a certain extent describes him,
I have inserted it here.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Marsilio Ficino</span> <i>to the noble</i> <span class="smcap">Lorenzo de’ Medici</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Even as harmony delights us more at the moment it strikes our ears
than when we remember tunes we have heard, and the actual sight of war
moves us more than any recital thereof, thus the great deeds of noble
and illustrious men animate our courage far more than the words of
orators and philosophers who dispute about valour. For it is ordered
by nature that things themselves should be more potent than their
names, and that real events should move the soul with greater force
than what is either false or may have happened. Therefore by imitating
the deeds of Socrates we are taught better how to attain courage
than by the art displayed by Aristotle in his writings on morality.
And Christ solely by His example has done more to make us adopt a
holy and virtuous way of life than all the orators and philosophers
that ever existed. Therefore, my Lorenzo, whilst I applaud you for
not despising the writings which teach morals, I beg you to prefer
learning from reality instead of from description, as you would
prefer a living thing from a dead. Particularly as you have decided
to emulate that aged man on whom our Senate bestowed the title of
Father of His Country. I mean the great Cosimo, your grandfather and
my lord. A man prudent above all men, pious towards God, just and most
charitable towards men, temperate in living, diligent in his care for
his family, and still more so in the affairs of the Republic; a most
honourable man who lived not only for himself, but for the good of
his country and his God; whose soul was as humble as any man’s, and
yet great and exalted. I, my Lorenzo, for more than twelve years gave
myself up to philosophy with him. He was as acute in reasoning as he
was prudent and strong in governing.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span> Certainly I owe much to Plato,
but must confess that I owe no less to Cosimo. Inasmuch as Plato only
once showed me the Idea of courage, Cosimo showed it me every day.
For the moment I will not mention his other qualities. Cosimo was
as avaricious and careful of time as Midas of money; he spent his
days parsimoniously, carefully counting every hour and avariciously
saving every second; he often lamented the loss of hours. Finally,
having like Solon the philosophor (even when occupied in most serious
business) diligently studied philosophy, yet even till the last day
when he departed from this world of shadows to go to light he devoted
himself to the acquisition of knowledge. For when we had read together
Plato’s book dealing with the <i>Origin of the Universe</i> and the
<i>Summum Bonum</i> he, as you who were present well know, soon
after quitted this life as though he was really going to enjoy that
happiness which he had tasted during our conversations. Farewell, and
as God fashioned Cosimo according to the Idea of the world, do you
continue as you have begun to fashion yourself according to the Idea
of Cosimo.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Brief Memorandum by Piero de’ Medici about his Father’s Death</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I record that on the 1st August 1464, at the hour of 22-1/2, Cosimo di
Giovanni de’ Medici quitted this life, having been a great sufferer
from pains in his joints, although free from all other ills. Towards
the end of his life he was afflicted with suppression of urine, which
caused frequent fever. He was seventy-seven years of age, a tall,
handsome man, and healthy, save for the above-mentioned ills. Of great
prudence and still greater kindness, he was the most eminent and
the richest citizen our city had possessed for many years, and was
trusted and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span> loved by the people above all other men. Indeed there is
no record of any citizen who died at that age who was so kind and so
famous, and was so universally mourned and with reason, for no man
ever had to complain of him, but many have been helped, and succoured,
and assisted, for his greatest pleasure lay in aiding others; not
only relations and friends, but strangers; and what is more difficult
to believe, and still more difficult to accomplish, those who were
unfriendly. By such praiseworthy actions he made many persons his
friends, who by their own fault or the fault of others had been his
enemies. He was liberal, charitable, and merciful, and gave many
alms during his life, not only in the city and the State, but in far
distant places for things pertaining to religion, rebuilding churches,
and giving for other worthy objects which had come under his notice.
He was highly esteemed and believed in by all the lords and princes in
and out of Italy. He filled all the greatest positions in our city,
all foreign ones he declined; but he joined in the most important and
honourable embassies sent by our Republic in his time. In the city
his commerce enriched many men, besides procuring a large fortune to
himself. He was not only a wise and cautious man of business, but a
lucky one. As has been said, he died on the aforesaid day in our house
at Careggi, after receiving all the sacraments of Holy Church with
the utmost devotion and reverence. He would not make a will, but left
everything in my hands. He was buried in the church of S. Lorenzo in
the earth, in the sepulchre ordered by him, without any honours or
pomp, as he would have none but the canons and priests of the said
church, the friars of S. Marco, and the canons regular of the Badia of
Fiesole, and neither more nor less wax torches than were used at an
ordinary funeral. This he ordered with his last breath; saying that
alms-giving and other good works ought to be performed while alive,
as he had done, and were then of more use. Notwithstanding I, wishing
to pay my filial debt to paternal piety, did what was requisite on
account of those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span> who remained, ordering alms and masses, as follows
in this book.</p>


<p class="center"><i>Note of the Funeral and of the Masses that are to be said in the
Church of S. Lorenzo and in other places for the Soul of Cosimo di
Giovanni de’ Medici, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p>On the morning of August 2, which was Thursday, the funeral took place
in the church of S. Lorenzo; for wax we paid lire 43-1/2; for torches,
94 lbs. of candles for putting in the church, and 13 small torches to
be carried by the priests, in all 190-1/2 lbs., and for 16 torches of
97 lbs. for placing round the body.</p>


<p class="center"><i>Note of the Masses and Offices celebrated for the Soul of Cosimo</i></p>

<p>To the Chapter and priests of S. Lorenzo for an office lasting eight
consecutive days, beginning on August 3rd; with 30 masses for each
office, which make 8 offices, with 240 masses for the octave, we paid
16 lire for 6 torches of 33 lbs. and 10 lbs. of candles.</p>

<p>To the Chapter and priests of S. Lorenzo for an office beginning on
August 11th, and continuing for thirty consecutive days, finishing on
the 11th September, we paid 60 lire per torch of wax of 170 lbs.</p>
</div>

<p>Then follows a long list of members of the family, friends, dependants,
and slaves, each of whom had from 30 to 10 braccia each of black cloth
for the funeral; the women of the family had also black veils and
kerchiefs.</p>

<p>Besides the many offices celebrated in Florence for the soul of Cosimo,
the various Companies of Rome, Venice, Milan, Bruges, Geneva, London,
and Avignon celebrated a great many; and liberal alms were given, and
many prisoners were pardoned and set free from divers prisons.</p>

<p>Cosimo de’ Medici died at Careggi on August 1, 1464. His family, as has
been said, respected his wish that he should be buried as a private
citizen, without any public and official pomp. His fellow-citizens
nevertheless resolved to commemorate in some special fashion the
decease of the real head of their State. A minute setting forth his
services was incorporated in the <i>Acta</i> of the Ten, who also
passed a law declaring that he was to be afterwards known by the title
of <i>Pater Patriæ</i>, and appointed Donato Acciaiuoli to commend
its adoption to the people in a set oration. The law was adopted by
acclamation, and Cosimo is always known as Cosimo Pater Patriæ.</p>

the physical strength necessary for his position. He was a martyr to
gout, from whence his surname <i>il Gottoso</i>. Kindly and indolent
by nature, he could be stern, terse, and eloquent when roused, and
his political insight was keen. The commencement of his reign, if
one may use the word, was unfortunate. Cosimo on his deathbed had
recommended his son to consult Diotisalvi Neroni, and to follow his

Machiavelli’s account of the conspiracy which so nearly wrecked the
power of the house of Medici is as follows:</p>

<p>“Messer Diotisalvi, moved more by his own ambition than by affection
for Piero or gratitude for the benefits he had received from Cosimo,
thought it would be easy to ruin Piero’s credit, and to deprive him of
the authority inherited from his father. He therefore gave him advice
which appeared most honest and reasonable, but in reality was meant
to lead to his ruin. Showing him the disorder in his affairs, and how
much money was absolutely necessary to save his own credit and that
of the State, he declared that the most honourable way to remedy his
difficulties would be to call in the debts due to his father by both
foreigners and citizens. For Cosimo, in order to gain partisans in
Florence and friends abroad, had been most generous in the use of his
riches, and the moneys owing to him amounted to a very considerable
sum. Such counsel seemed good and honest to Piero, who wished to remedy
his affairs with his own means. But as soon as he demanded repayment
of these loans the citizens, as though he wanted to take what was
theirs and not what was his own, complained<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span> loudly, and showed
small respect in speaking ill of him, and accusing him of ingratitude
and avarice. When Messer Diotisalvi saw the universal disfavour his
advice had brought on Piero he joined Messer Luca Pitti, Messer Agnolo
Acciaiuoli, and Niccolò Soderini, and they conspired to deprive Piero
of his credit and his authority. They were influenced by various
motives. Messer Luca aspired to fill the position held by Cosimo,
having become so great a man that he disdained to obey Piero. Messer
Diotisalvi, knowing that Messer Luca was unfit to be the head of the
government, thought that once Piero was out of the way the management
must of necessity fall to him. Niccolò Soderini desired that the city
should enjoy more freedom, and be governed according to the wishes of
the magistrates, while Messer Agnolo had private reasons for hating the
Medici. Some time before his son Raffaello had married Alessandra de’
Bardi, whose dower was very large. Owing either to her own misconduct,
or to the faults of others, she was maltreated by her father-in-law and
her husband; so one night Lorenzo d’Ilarione, her kinsman, moved to
pity for the girl, with many men-at-arms, took her away from the house
of Messer Agnolo. The Acciaiuoli complained of the insult done to them
by the Bardi, and the matter being laid before Cosimo he decreed that
the dower was to be repaid to Alessandra, and that she was to decide
whether she would or would not return to her husband. Messer Agnolo
did not think that in delivering this judgment Cosimo had behaved as
a friend, and not being able to do anything against him he determined
to take revenge on his son. The conspirators, though animated by such
diverse motives, agreed to give the same reason publicly, declaring
that they desired the city to be ruled by magistrates and not by the
uncontrolled will of a few men. The hatred felt against Piero and the
reasons for attacking him, were increased by the bankruptcy of many
merchants for which he was blamed; his unexpected demand to be repaid
having caused these men to fail, and thus brought great discredit and
loss upon the city.”<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a></p>

<p>PIERO DI COSIMO DE’ MEDICI.</p>

</figure>

<p>Florence was divided into two camps, the Party of the Hill, so-called
because Luca Pitti’s palace was being erected on the highest part of
the city, and the Party of the Plain, because the palace of the Medici
was on the flat. “While things were in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span> this disorder,” continues
Machiavelli, “the time arrived for renewing the chief magistrate, and
Niccolò Soderini was elected Gonfalonier of Justice.” But Niccolò
wasted his two months’ tenure of office in futile attempts to “reform”
the government, accomplished nothing, and quitted office a discredited
man. The conspirators then determined to murder Piero as he returned to
Florence from his villa of Careggi. He was only saved by the presence
of mind of his young son Lorenzo, who preceded him on horseback,
and noticed armed men loitering on the road. Lorenzo rode quietly
on announcing that Piero was close behind him, but sent back in hot
haste a messenger to order his father’s litter to take an unfrequented
lane. Luca Pitti, perceiving that if the Medici were swept away
Neroni and not himself would be the head of the Republic, betrayed
his fellow-conspirators, and made peace with Piero. His defection was
a death-blow to the conspiracy and to his own fortunes. Neroni and
Niccolò Soderini fled to Venice, Acciaiuoli to Siena first and then to
Naples, and the power of the Medici was once more firmly established.</p>

<p>Piero inherited his father’s love of letters and of art. He was the
first to employ Luca della Robbia, who decorated the ceiling of his
study in the Medici palace and made tiles for the floor, which, as
Vasari says, “was a new thing and most excellent for summer.” Luca also
made the vaulted roof of the marble chapel of the Crucifix inside the
ancient church of S. Miniato a Monte, erected by Piero’s orders by his
father’s faithful friend, Michelozzo Michelozzi.</p>

<p>Whatever currents of opinion disturbed the city of Florence at the
death of Cosimo de’ Medici, foreign powers universally recognised his
son Piero as his successor in the rule of the Republic. The Pope sent
him a letter of condolence on his father’s death, while the King of
France, Louis XI., testified his regard for the Medici by creating him
a Privy Councillor, and giving him the right to add the Lily of France
to the arms of his family.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Pope Pius II.</span> <i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Piero de’ Medici</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Beloved Son</span>,—Greeting and apostolic blessing. We have
just heard that Cosimo, your father, has departed this life.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span> This
is indeed bitter and mournful news, and most grievous to us. For we
loved him with sincere affection as a man whom we always found devoted
to ourselves and to the Apostolic See, whom we knew to be gifted
with unusual insight and kindness. Yet, my son, though many besides
yourself will mourn his death, you must bear with a brave heart this
fate which divine law has ordained for mortals. Accept this expression
of God’s will patiently, and do not give way to grief. If you consider
the course of human existence, Cosimo has had a long life; he has
paid his debt to nature, and in his old age he has gone the way of
all flesh. His life was full of honour; his glory extended beyond his
own city to all Italy, nay, to the whole world; he has lived in the
highest esteem and, what we must value more, in piety, and abiding in
the fear of God. It is not right to mourn the death of a man who has
lived righteously and justly, since we must believe that he has gone
from this troubled human existence to one that is full of peace and
tranquillity. As for us, beloved son, we intend to preserve towards
you the feelings we had for your father, and for him we had a singular
paternal affection. We promise that we shall always do what in our
judgment will be conducive to your honour and your interest, and to
that of the house of Medici. This we wish you to understand.—Given at
Ancona under the seal of the Fisherman, the 8th day of August 1464, in

<p><span class="smcap">Most dear and great Friend</span>,—We have received by our beloved
and faithful courier Francesco Nori your letters which you sent to
us by him. From him and from your letters we have learned how kindly
you have acted in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span> our favour towards our dear and beloved uncle the
Duke of Milan about the affair of the Marches of which we wrote,
and we are much pleased and very grateful to you. We also heard of
the death of the late Cosimo de’ Medici, our great friend and your

singular love we bore him and for the great and laudable services he
rendered to us and to the French crown during his whole life. For the
enduring memory thereof and of the friendship he showed to us and to

and family, and for the salvation of his soul, we beg you to dedicate
to the service of your said dead father banners with our arms, of
such number as seems best to you and is customary in such cases. We
have also, in order to show the confidence we place in you, in your
wisdom, loyalty, goodness, and diligence, and for the preservation of
the friendship and goodwill which always existed between your late
father and ourselves, appointed you one of our privy councillors, and
have ordered the letters patent to be made out, which we send by the

<p><i>Privilege granted by Louis XI. to the Medici to quarter the Lily of
France in their arms</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Louis, by the grace of God King of France. We make known to all
present and for the future: Bearing in mind the great, praiseworthy,
and much to be commended fame enjoyed by the late Cosimo de’ Medici
during his life in all his actions and his affairs, which he conducted
with such great virtue and prudence that his children and other
relatives and friends must<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span> be commended and held in high honour.
For these reasons and moved by the supplication and prayer which has
been addressed to us by our friends, and by our loyal Councillor
Piero de’ Medici, son of the said late Cosimo de’ Medici, we by
our own will, special grace, full power and royal authority decree
and command by these presents that the said Piero de’ Medici ...
his heirs and successors born and to be born in legal wedlock may
henceforward and for ever have and bear in the arms three Fleur de
lis of the shape and manner herein portrayed.... And these arms we
have given and give to them by these said presents, to use as seems
good to them in all places and among all people, in time of peace or
in time of war, without any impediment either now or hereafter being
placed to their so doing. And in order that this thing should be firm
and stable for ever, we have caused our seal to be set to these two
presents, reserving our rights in all other things and our authority
in everything.—Given at Mont Luçon in the month of May, the year of
grace 1465, and the fourth year of our reign.<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Owing to Piero’s miserable health, his son Lorenzo was sent, even as
quite a lad, to visit foreign courts and to receive foreign princes
who passed through Tuscany. Thus in April 1465 he met Don Federigo
d’Aragona, second son of the King of Naples, at Pisa, on his way to
Milan to escort his eldest brother’s bride, Ippolita Maria, daughter
of Francesco Sforza, to Naples. The two youths formed a lasting
friendship, and on Federigo’s return with his sister-in-law they came
to Florence and stayed in the Medici palace. Ippolita and Lorenzo then
became such friends that she never hesitated to appeal to him when,
as often happened in the needy Neapolitan court, she wanted money.
They often corresponded, and when Lorenzo went to Naples in 1479, the
Duchess of Calabria and Don Federigo were his powerful allies. The
following letter, a remarkable one for a lad of seventeen, was sent
to Don Federigo with a volume of poems selected from those writers
Lorenzo considered to be masters of the Tuscan tongue.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span> There are two
copies in Florence, one in the Nazionale Library,<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> the other in the

<p><i>The Magnificent</i> <span class="smcap">Lorenzo</span> to the Illustrious <span class="smcap">Lord
Federigo</span>, <i>son of the King of Naples</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Often have I reflected, Illustrious my Lord Federigo, which among the
many and infinite poems of antiquity is the most excellent. Certes,
one must have been more admirable than the others. It has always
been a matter of surprise to me that no great and fine work was
originated in ancient times, either of hands or head, which did not
receive private and public recognition and reward. So as all rivers
and springs are said to have their origin from the great Ocean, all
the famous deeds and marvellous works of bygone men may be said to
derive from this laudable habit. The nutriment of every art is honour,
and by the desire of glory alone are men’s minds spurred to produce
admirable works. Thus in Rome we see magnificent triumphal entries,
in Greece the famous Olympian games, and both are celebrated by poets
and orators with infinite mastery. For this alone were the chariot
and the triumphal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span> arch, the highly decorated theatres, the statues,
the palm branches, the garlands, the funereal honours; for this alone
were devised other splendid ornaments, and thus were encouraged high
and noble deeds of the intellect and of the sword, all the marvellous
works of the great men of ancient days, who assuredly (as our Tuscan
poet says) will never lack fame so long as this world lasts. These
of a truth were great and divine men, desirous of enduring fame and
supremely grateful to those who, by celebrating the valour and noble
deeds of great men in fine poetry, made their names immortal. Inflamed
by such desire, Alexander the Great on seeing the tomb of the famous
Achilles with a sigh uttered those memorable words: “Fortunate art
thou to have so glorious a sepulchre and to have been sung by such a
pen.” Fortunate indeed. For without the divine poet Homer Achilles’
body and fame would have been buried in one tomb together. And even
this poet, excellent above all others, would not have attained such
honour and glory had he not been so admired by a learned Athenian,
almost one may say raised from death to life. For after his death
the great poet’s noble work was scattered and dismembered until
Pisistratus, prince of Athens, a man endowed with many virtues and
of noble presence, offered large rewards to whosoever brought him
verses by Homer. Thus with great diligence and care he collected
and reconstructed the glorious poem, giving to it eternal life and
to himself everlasting glory. For this reason the only epitaph on
his statue is the record that he collected the poems of the great
Homer. Oh, truly divine men, born for the good of humanity and of
the world. The prince knew that his other deeds, however admirable,
were as nothing compared with this one poem. Such were these antique
men, whose deeds are not to be equalled in later times, and indeed
are hardly believed. For as rewards for noble deeds no longer exist
the flame of courage is extinguished; and as men do nothing worthy of
praise the singers of great deeds are despised. If this had not been
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span> case we should not now mourn the loss of so many Greek and Latin
writers. With them have also perished many of our own old poets, who
had begun to cultivate the desert fields of the Tuscan tongue, which
now again, in our century, are covered with wild flowerets and weeds.
But thy gracious hand, Illustrious Federigo, which thou hast deigned
extend to them will, after their long struggle, lead them safely into
port.</p>

<p>When we were together last year in the ancient city of Pisa we spoke
of those who had written poetry in the Tuscan tongue, and thy Lordship
expressed a desire that I should collect their works in one volume for
thee. Being desirous in this, as in all other matters, to fulfil thy
wishes I have, not without great labour, caused search to be made for
the works of all the old poets, and choosing the less rugged pieces
have gathered them into the volume I now send thy Lordship, in the
hopes that my efforts, such as they are, may please and that thou wilt
accept it in memory of me and as a proof of my true affection. Let
no one, however, despise this Tuscan tongue as unadorned or diffuse.
For if its richness and beauty be rightly understood it will not be
accounted rugged but rich and refined. There is nothing delicate,
elegant, graceful, or ornate, nothing witty, ingenious or subtle,
nothing ample and rich, nothing magnificent and sonorous, finally
nothing ardent, bold, or moving, that is not found in those two
magnates Dante and Petrarch, and even in others of whom thou, my Lord,
didst cite brilliant examples. Poetry (according to what Petrarch
writes in a Latin epistle) was held in high honour by the old Romans,
and after long neglect appeared again in Sicily not so many centuries
ago; then passing into France finally came to Italy as though to its
own home. The first who courted the new style was Guittone of Arezzo,
and about the same time the famous Bolognese, Guido Guizzinello. Both
were learned in philosophy, serious, and sententious. The first rather
harsh and severe and without the gift of eloquence, the second far
more lucid, suave, and ornate, so that our honoured<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span> Dante did not
scruple to call him his father and also father of others who wrote
love songs of great sweetness and charm. He was certainly the first to
colour and soften our language, which had only been roughly sketched
out by the rude Aretine. After them emerged the elegant Florentine,
Guido Cavalcanti, a subtle logician and philosopher, an honour to
his age. As he was handsome and graceful in person and of most noble
blood, so there was in his writings something, I know not what, more
beautiful, noble, and rare, than in others. Acute in reasoning,
sonorous, admirable, and grave in his sentences, rich and elevated
in composition, wise and prudent; and all these gifts are enhanced,
and as clothed in a precious garment, by a rare and exquisite style.
Had he used this on a wider field no doubt he would have attained to
the highest honours. One of his most admirable works is a song in
which this subtle and charming poet describes every quality, virtue,
and precedent of love. This was held in such high estimation that it
was commentated by three renowned philosophers, his contemporaries,
among them the Roman Egidio. We must not forget Bonagiunta of Lucca
and the notary of Lentino, both grave and sententious writers, but
so devoid of charm that they may be proud to be mentioned in the
company of these honoured men. They, and Pier delle Vigne in the
time of Guittone, were celebrated. The little written by the latter
is not without solemnity and erudition. He was the keeper (as Dante
says) of the keys of Frederick’s heart, and locked and unlocked it
at his pleasure. After these shone those two great men who illumined
our tongue, Dante and Petrarch. Of them (as Sallust says of Carthage)
I think it better to say nothing than to say too little. Onesto the
Bolognese and the earlier Silicians who flourished before them and
were therefore less versed in their art, did not lack talent or
ambition. Cino da Pistoja, in my estimation, well deserves his high
reputation; tender and loving, he was the first to entirely shake off
the antique ruggedness of which the divine Dante<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span> was not altogether
free. Then comes a long line of more modern writers who are far behind
those two great ones. All these, and with them some of our own time,
come to thank thee, who art more worthy of praise than that ancient
Athenian already mentioned. He only gave immortality to one, whilst
thou givest it to many. At the end of the volume (as seemed to be
thy desire) we have copied a few of our own sonnets and songs, so
that when reading them thou canst remember my loyalty and affection.
Although not worthy to be placed among the splendid works of the old
poets, yet they may serve as a foil to show their greater beauty.
Receive, therefore, Illustrious Lord, this volume and myself, not only
in thy house, but in thy heart and soul, as thou hast a blithe and
enduring abode in ours.</p>
</div>

<p>In the commentary Lorenzo wrote on some of his sonnets he not only, as
in the above letter, praises Italian, but affirms its equality with the
classic languages, and declares that neither Ovid, Tibullus, Catullus,
or Propertius wrote love songs of such beauty and grace as Petrarch.
It was by this enthusiastic participation in the intellectual pursuits
and interests of his day that Lorenzo, even as a youth, attained such
popularity with his fellow-citizens. They were proud of the lad who was
already known as a poet, who excelled in all bodily exercises, and who
was treated by foreign princes and potentates as an equal. The above
letter to Federigo d’Aragona shows that he was, to quote John Addington
Symonds: “A Florentine of the Florentines. Tuscan to the backbone,
imbued with the spirit of his city, a passionate lover of her customs
and pastimes, a complete master of her vernacular. His education,
though it fitted him for Platonic discussions with Ficino and rendered
him an amateur of humanistic culture, had failed to make a pedant of
him. Much as he appreciated the classics, he preferred his Tuscan
poets; and what he learned at school he brought to bear upon the study
of the native literature.”<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a></p>

<p>Soon after his return from Pisa Lorenzo was despatched by his father
to Bologna, Ferrara, Venice, and Milan. Piero calls<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span> the journey
“the touchstone of thy abilities.” The letters show that the boy of
seventeen was received as a prince, and discussed with the rulers of
the various states he visited important political matters, in all of
which he was kept carefully informed by his father. At the same time,
with characteristic Medicean shrewdness, Lorenzo was instructed to
place himself in the hands of his father’s agents in each city visited,
and the whole journey could be represented as a tour of inspection of
the various agencies of a great banking-house, and the introduction of
the heir to the business of the family.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Thou hast arrived at Milan later than I thought, and perhaps than
thou didst wish, on account of the delay caused by the honours paid
thee by the Duke at Ferrara. I have written to thank him, and to say
we are his debtors, and also to Messer Giovanni Bentivoglio I have
sent thanks, &amp;c. Thou art to follow the advice of Pigello<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> and his
written instructions; be careful not to worry the Duke, he will have
enough of that with this marriage.<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> Thou art to consider thyself
as the servant and as belonging to the household of his Excellency,
and to ask Pigello’s advice as to what visits to pay, and what to
say. Remember to be civil and alert; act as a man and not as a boy.
Show sense, industry, and manly endeavour, so that thou mayst be

of thy abilities. I sent by carrier the rest of the silver [plate] to
Pigello, but have not yet heard of its arrival. If thou needst aught
else let me know, but Pigello will provide all that is necessary.
Consult with him about inviting Don Federigo one day to the house
there, or anything else thou thinkest needful. Arrange with him
after due reflection, and whatever is settled do with splendour and
in honourable fashion. Gugliemo,<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> thou, and Pigello can settle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>

not stint money, but do thyself honour. When thou hast time, after
having paid thy visits, commend me to the Duke and to Madonna, to
Count Galeazzo and to whoso else thou thinkest right. Amuse thyself
and do not worry about us here, the time will come soon enough when
thou wilt have to do so. Nannina is well again; we will talk about her
marriage after thy return from Naples. Gugliemo’s family are all well;
tell him not to forget them entirely, and be not so taken up with all
those festivities as to forget thyself. I think thou hast better leave
there a few days before the others, because as I have Madonna the
Princess here in our house, and Gugliemo and thyself being absent, I
shall be as a man without hands, but of this I will write later. No
more at present. Christ guard thee.—Florence, May 4, 1465.<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a></p>

which I approve and commend, and I think thou hast paid nearly all
necessary visits. Thou wilt have received my letter of the 4th telling
thee what conduct to pursue, all of which remember; in a word, it is
necessary for thee now to be a man and not a boy; be so in words,
deeds, and manners, and if thou givest dinners or other entertainments
do not let there be any stint in money or whatever else is needful
to do thyself honour. For the present I say no more. Before leaving
thou shalt hear what to do. I have consulted with the citizens here,
and they all agree that I must receive the princes<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> in our house
on their return, and the Signoria has commanded me to do so: I obey
willingly, but it would have taken much trouble off my hands hadst
thou and Gugliemo been here; however, we will do the best we can. It
will be better for thee to leave a few days before the others, thou
shalt be warned in time. I did not write to Venice because the delay
at Ferrara threw out all arrangements, but it is of no consequence.
All our family here are well, and we hope thou art the same and wilt
return in safety. We are preparing great festivities for these princes
on S. John’s day, and shall try and do them honour also in other
ways. Our Giuliano has been persuaded by Baccio Benci and others to
arrange a tournament, but in more magnificent fashion than usual. The
Signoria wishes it; I am against it, and shall try to get out of it if
possible. I do not want to have so many bothers at the same time, and
am astonished that Giovanni de’ Pazzi, having done it once, undertakes
to do it again. Thou shalt know what is decided. No more at present.

<p>S. John’s Day (24th June) is still a great holiday in Florence. The
cathedral and the baptistery are illuminated, and fireworks (the
scaffoldings for which used to be erected on the Ponte della Carraja
until the tramway took possession of the bridge) are now let off on the
Piazza Michelangelo. An old chronicler writes: “On the day of S. John,
the patron saint of the city, and on the vigil thereof, not only are
there infinite demonstrations of spiritual joy, but everything that can
be done in such a city is done to show temporal happiness and gaiety.
Swift horses called <i>Barberi</i> race in public for a <i>palio</i>,
or banner, of cloth of gold lined with precious fur. Merchants display
untold riches in gold, jewels, pearls, and money, and in cloth of gold,
silks, and woollen goods of incredible value. There are illuminations,
bonfires, and fireworks, both public and private, and the whole city
is given over to rejoicing. Among other diversions is jousting. This
is a game played by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span> men clothed in the richest damasks and costumes
and varied liveries, according to the costumes and liveries of their
families, who place themselves in proper order in the field (having
first triumphantly escorted an emperor in a gilded car, with a fine and
noble procession of kings, dukes, marquesses, counts, soldiers, and
baggage waggons), on splendidly caparisoned horses, well trained to
race. First they race in the public squares, and then in certain places
set apart for breakneck exercises they break lances with no small
dexterity.”</p>

<p>On that day also the Signori, surrounded by their attendants,
and the soldiers and trumpeters of the Commune, sat on the
<i>ringhiera</i><a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> of the Palazzo Vecchio, in their magnificent
official costumes, which must have been rather trying in hot summer
weather. The Gonfalonier was clad in a long loose crimson velvet
coat lined with ermine and embroidered with golden stars; his
<i>berretta</i>, or cap, was turned up with ermine and trimmed with
gold lace, pearls, and silver embroidery, like the rays of stars. The
crimson coats of cloth worn by the Priors were also lined with ermine,
and had ermine collars and cuffs, and they wore a large red berretta
or a hood. The Podestà dressed like the Priors, but without a hood;
the Preposto’s coat was of black satin, and his <i>lucco</i> of black
velvet was lined with satin of various colours, and he always wore a
hood. Seated thus in state, the Signori received tribute from all the
cities, castles, and villages that were under their rule or protection.</p>

<p>Dati enlarges on the magnificent and marvellous aspect of the Piazza
della Signoria, “with one hundred towers, which shone like gold,
some on waggons, some borne on the shoulders of men. These last,
made of wood, pasteboard, and coloured wax figures, are called
tapers (<i>ceri</i>). Inside the towers are men, who cause these
figures to move and to turn round. They represented horsemen tilting,
foot-soldiers with spears or waving banners, and girls dancing in a
ring. Near and around the <i>ringhiera</i> hung a hundred or more
<i>palii</i> or banners, their staves being stuck into the iron
rings on the walls. First were those of the chief cities who send
tribute to the Commune,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span> as Pisa, Arezzo, Pistoja, Volterra, Cortona,
Lucignano, and Castiglione Aretino, and of certain lords of Poppi
and Piombino, who are under the protection of the Commune, made of
thick velvet, lined with satin or with silk; the rest are of strips
of thinner velvet, or of other cloth or silk; so that the sight is
truly marvellous. The first offering in the morning is made by the
Captains of the Guelph party, with all their knights and gentlemen, and
ambassadors and foreign knights who accompany them, and a great number
of the most honourable citizens of Florence; the great banner of the
Guelph party being borne before them by one of their followers on a
tall horse, caparisoned in white cloth embroidered with the device of
the Guelph party. Then followed the afore-mentioned <i>palii</i>, or
banners, each one carried by a man on horseback, and both man and horse
are clothed in silk. One after another they go in the order in which
they were called to offer the said <i>palii</i> to the church of S.
Giovanni, which are the tributes paid by the places conquered by the
Florentines.</p>

<p>“The <i>ceri</i>, or tapers, which resemble golden towers, are the
tributes of the most ancient possessions of the Florentines, and
according to their rank they proceed one after another to offer them
to S. Giovanni, and the next day the tapers are all stuck up round
the inside of the church where they remain until the next feast-day,
when they are removed and used for the altars, and some are sold by
auction. After the tapers a marvellous quantity of large wax candles
are offered, some of a hundred pounds weight, some of fifty or less,
carried by the peasants belonging to the villas from whence they are
sent. Then the Masters of the Mint offer a splendid taper, borne on
a richly adorned car drawn by a pair of oxen whose loin-cloths bear
the device of the Mint, and the said Masters are accompanied by about
four hundred venerable men, all matriculated in and belonging to the
Guild of Cloth-weavers. The last to make offerings are the Signori,
the Priors, and their colleagues, with the Podestà and the Captain,
in great pomp with many servants, and so many instruments, fifes and
trumpets, that the whole world seemed to resound. After the Signori had
left, all the horses that have come for the race are presented, and
then the Flemings and Brabanters—weavers of woollen cloth—who are in
Florence make their offering; and lastly, twelve prisoners, delivered
from gaol for love of God in honour of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span> S. Giovanni, are offered to
him. When all this has been done, men and women return home to dine,
and in all the city that day are so many marriages and great banquets,
with innumerable fifes, music, songs, dances, and gaiety, that it
seemed as though the place was Paradise.”</p>

<p>In 1466 Piero sent Lorenzo, then eighteen years of age, to Rome on a
mission of great moment both politically and commercially. Perhaps the
most important part of the private business was to secure from the Pope
a monopoly of working the alum mines discovered not many years before
in the short range of volcanic hills lying round the little village
of La Tolfa (Tofa), about eleven miles due west of Civita Vecchia and
within the Pope’s dominions. A few deposits of alum had been known and
partially worked in Europe, <i>i.e.</i> at Volterra and Ischia: but for
all practical purposes almost all the alum used in Christendom came
from Asia Minor, and the supply was always inferior to the increasing
demand. A certain Giovanni di Castro prospecting among the hills
round La Tolfa found what he believed to be an inexhaustible supply,
“seven hills of alum.” Castro made sure of his find by calcinating
the stone. He then hastened to Rome, appeared before the Pope, and
somewhat grandiloquently announced his discovery. “I make known to you
a victory over the Turk. He draws yearly from the Christians more than
300,000 pieces of gold, paid to him for the alum with which we dye
wool of various colours, because none is found in Italy, save a little
at Ischia.... I have found seven hills so abounding in alum that they
might supply seven worlds. If you will send workmen, cause furnaces
to be built and the stone to be calcined, you may furnish almost all
Europe, and what money the Turk used to acquire will fall into your
hands.” The Holy See made haste to secure the newly-found treasure, and
in order to have a monopoly in the sale the Pope excommunicated every
one who tried to import alum into Europe from the Turkish dominions. So
determined were the Popes to maintain what in modern language would be
called their “corner in alum,” that in the proclamation of Indulgences
it was always expressly declared that the pardon promised did not
include those who imported alum into Europe from the Turkish dominions.</p>

<p>Such a deposit needed capital to work it properly and the Holy See
farmed out the monopoly, protected by excommunication,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span> to a firm of
capitalists. Young Lorenzo was instructed to secure, and did obtain,
this very valuable concession for his family. Hereafter the profits of
the monopoly of alum were a source of great wealth to the Medici.</p>

<p>The political problem, overshadowing all others, entrusted to the
youthful Lorenzo was the maintenance of the league between the King of
Naples, Milan, and Florence. This was the keystone of Piero’s foreign
policy. He believed it to be essential to the balance of power and the
preservation of peace in the peninsula. The alliance received an almost
deadly blow in the somewhat sudden death of Francesco Sforza, the Duke
of Milan, and Piero’s fears are reflected in the despairing letters
he wrote to his son. The league between the three powers survived the
shock. Francesco Sforza’s son Galeazzo was, after some little delay,
universally recognised as his father’s successor, and the foreign
policy of Piero de’ Medici was maintained.</p>

<p>But the note of despair in Piero’s letters was probably occasioned
by a presentiment of what might, and what actually did, occur within
Florence herself. As has been said, many of the hitherto strenuous
supporters of the Medici within the Republic were inclined to revolt
against the continuance of their rule, and the death of Francesco
Sforza furnished the occasion for testing their strength. It had been
part of Cosimo’s foreign policy to support Sforza at Milan by a subsidy
from the Florentine treasury. On his death the question was at once
raised whether the grant was to be continued to his successor Galeazzo.
Piero supported its continuance. It was part of the Triple Alliance and
an essential portion of his foreign policy. Yet it was also capable
of being represented as something which concerned only the internal
affairs of the city. This was at once seized upon by Luca Pitti and
Diotisalvi Neroni. We see all these fears reflected in the letters of
Piero to Lorenzo while the latter was at Rome.</p>

<p>The letter from Luigi Pulci shows how the young Lorenzo was already
recognised as one of the foremost citizens of Florence and the future
lord of the city, round whom aspiring men desired to rally. Pulci
had been banished from Florence and was in hiding on account of his
brother’s debts for which he had become surety.</p>

<p><i>Sis felix, mi Laurenti</i>, &amp;c.—Thou hast decided to leave me
in these woods among the snow, so lonely and so desolate, and to go
to Rome. Such is my destiny that to all my other troubles is added
this one, that I am never to go a journey with thee on horseback.
When shall I go? When I am quite old? What more faithful servant or
companion canst thou find who is more maltreated and repulsed by
heaven? How many times have we talked together about Rome, and that I
was to be there with thee: why dost thou leave me, art thou afraid I
should be an expense to thee? Do not fear, for in spite of my adverse
fortune I should still do thee honour. From thee I should only need
a horse. I have so many friends in that city and enough wits not to
shame thee as perhaps thou fearest. Of a truth thou drivest me from
thee wrongfully, and it would be unjust to leave me so unhappy: this
hurts me more than anything else. Do not cast me aside like old broken
iron, I shall be sound enough if thou lovest me. And even were I
broken to bits I should have the more need of help and comfort. In the
midst of thy prosperity remember my misfortunes. Generous hearts and
true friends act thus; and my old affection and well-tried fidelity
merit it. Time will pass. It would be a great restorative after so
many troubles which I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span> have now unjustly suffered for sixteen months.
It will prevent me from going to the devil, or into exile in strange
lands with strange thoughts. <i>Denique</i>, by all the Gods, by
everything, I pray thee to include me among the number of thy elected
for Rome; it will be enough, as I said before, if thou lendest me a
horse. If thou dost not want me, I will never more be thine nor any
one’s. So good-bye. I leave thee for a long time, thou wilt not see
me again, nor wilt thou know where I am, and God will pardon thee for
me, for I will never pardon thee. Also, if thou willst, surely some
means can be found for my security. The magistrates can protect me,
and if they set me free, as would only be just, a safe-conduct voted
by six of the Signori would be sufficient, or it would be enough if
the creditors promised thee not to molest me. But thou hast forgotten
me and art occupied, and thy mind is set on greater things. Thou art
right, but also, certes, I am not in the wrong to trust in thee alone,
because I am entirely thine and turn to thee as I have always done.
If thou dost not help me I have lost all hope. What am I to do? Give
myself to three hundred thousand devils?</p>

<p>If thou hast not received the swords tell me and I will go and wake
the man up; and if thou wilt send me a line written by thee, so that I
may know whether thou still lovest me or not, I should be very glad.
Many times have I taken my pen in hand for love of thee, so I wish
thou wouldst deign do the same for love of me. This alone will be to
me, among these mountains, what the Holy Ghost was to the Apostles
who thought God had forgotten them until the dove came to them. If
thou dost not do it no more verses, no more gossipings, never more
shall we be boon-companions. Tell me whether the affair we talked
about under the Tetto de’ Pisani is concluded and whether it will be
necessary; thou hast probably already tried a portion of it. Commend
me to our Magnificent Piero and to Madonna Lucrezia, and greet and
bless my Giuliano a thousand times, and also my Piero Allamanni and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>

<p>I am in such affliction and sorrow for the sad and untimely death of
the Illustrious Duke of Milan that I know not where I am; thou canst
imagine what it means to us both in private and in public matters.
Condole most heartily in my name with his ambassador, and take comfort
in thine own thoughts and do not give way to melancholy, which is
of no service; thoughts are sometimes useful when they are good. I,
although it is a hard blow, am trying to bear it and I hope time will
accomplish what as yet reason cannot. There are letters from Milan
of the 9th and the 10th which I send, so that thou canst see how
things are there. They may perhaps turn out better than many people
think. I wrote at once to the Holy Father to beg him, as head and
leader not only of the League but of all Christians, to think how
best to preserve the stability of that State, for His Holiness can
do more than any one else, if only for the preservation of peace and
tranquillity in Italy. Although I think His Holiness is well disposed
yet we must do our utmost, for thou knowest what we owe and what
is our duty to the blessed memory of the late Lord and towards Her
Excellency Madonna and her noble children. Put an end to all playing
on instruments, or singing or dancing, for Malatesta has arrived, so
let all be at least until after Easter. Do not talk about it because
I think we may have to change our plans. But thou shalt know what I
decide; meanwhile keep silence with all save Giovanni [Tornabuoni] and
Malatesta.</p>

<p>I see that thou hast arrived safely by thy letter of 8th, of which I
am glad, and that great honours were paid thee, for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span> which we must be
grateful to God and to the men of this world to whom we owe much. Thou
must study to merit this by deeds and be old beyond thine years, for
the times require it.</p>

<p>Of what happens there day by day, as I said before, take counsel with
Giovanni, and study the condition of that region and what state it is
in, so that on thy return thou canst give a clear report. No more at
present. Christ guard thee.</p>

<p>I forgot to say that last night letters of the 11th came from Mantua,
saying how that lord had agreed and stipulated to remain in the
service of King Ferrante [of Naples]; this is a good and useful thing.
We have also letters of the 11th to-day from Genoa, with news that
all those citizens have determined to be faithful to Madonna and
her children as they were to the Duke of blessed memory, and that
they have elected eight citizens to act with the governor in case of
need.—Florence, March 15, 1465 (1466).<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a></p>

<p>I wrote fully to thee lately, and now have thy letter of 15th saying
that the death of the Duke of Milan was known there, may God be
merciful to him, and of the arrangements made to send to Milan and
to write to others, and also of the Holy Father’s decision as to the
safety of that State, which satisfies every one. We are of the same
opinion; to do all that is possible for the Illustrious Madonna and
their noble children that accords with our own liberty. Probably
nothing more will be needed than the intimation of our intentions, as
up to the 17th, the last news I have from Milan, nothing had happened,
all passed off quietly. From what one hears from Venice the Signoria
there shows a desire to live in peace and quiet with Madonna and her
sons, as they did with the father of blessed memory. I am inclined
to believe this, it being their interest. I say no more, having told
thee enough in my other letter, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span> also because I send thee the
letter I have received from Venice. It is however of the greatest
importance and utility that His Sanctity our Holy Father should desire
to preserve peace and quiet in Italy, in which I conceive he will have
the aid of us all. I am sure that this is his desire, he having always
shown it, so I do not dwell on it, hoping that by the grace of God and
the help of His Holiness everything will go well.</p>

<p>I note that thou hast seen His Sanctity the Pope, and spoken about
the affair of Stefano da Osimo, and that His Holiness is satisfied;
it is necessary for the common good of the different parties and of
the whole city, and it seems to me that our Holy Father has understood
rightly and sagely that the affair cannot be ended but must be
maintained. It may be that time will make a change also in my views.
It is enough to know that it was not <i>de motu proprio</i> of His
Holiness, but was suggested by others. But above all see that he is
satisfied and content; were it otherwise I should be uneasy.</p>

<p>I know not what thou hast done about the deposit of alum, as I said
before I am content that thou shouldst accept it in my name, and
there can be no doubt that our conduct will be to the satisfaction
and the interest of our Holy Father. Consult about this with Giovanni
Tornabuoni, and settle this and other matters as you both think best.</p>

<p>About continuing thy journey beyond Rome I think, as I said before, it
would be better to wait until after Easter; we shall meanwhile know
more and be better able to decide. Thou hast done well to urge Messer
Agnolo to make haste, we expect him here every day. Return the letters
from Milan which I sent in my last letter, and those which I now send.
Here we are expecting to hear of the entry of the Illustrious Galeazzo
Maria. The Count of Urbino was at Scarperia on the 18th but did not
come here, probably not to lose time. By now he must be at Milan, as
well as the Lord Alessandro. Thou shalt hear what occurs. The Lord
Gismondo had arrived at Venice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span></p>

<p>The Archdeacon was at the point of death, but he is so much better
that it is not expected he will die of this illness. I highly approve
of thy thought of Pellegrino, and if the occasion had arisen would
have shown him how greatly I desire to please and to serve him. When
thou seest the Bishop of Raugia commend me to him, and also to Messer
Lionardo Dati. No more. Christ guard thee.—On the 22nd day of March

<p>After the conspiracy against Piero de’ Medici had been discovered,
Agnolo Acciaiuoli fled to Siena on his way to Naples. There he waited
some time in the vain hope that Piero would relent and permit him to

given by Fabroni, who copied from the archives, differs somewhat from
the more literary version given by Machiavelli.</p>

the cause of my not shedding tears, although I am sorry for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span> your
ill fortune. You have not shown your accustomed good sense, which in
such cases is necessary. Your guilt, as I said in a former letter,
is manifest and so great that neither my intercession nor that of
any other person would be of any avail. My nature is to forget and
forgive you, and all who have shown me enmity and hostility. I have
pardoned every offence; the Republic cannot and may not lightly do
so on account of the bad example, as you know better than I, having
had experience of such matters and having proclaimed it in public
and in private. You say you were exiled on my father’s account, and
for having saved what belonged to him. I do not deny your friendship
with my father and with us, which ought to have made you regard me
as a son, and as such I considered myself. You were banished with my
father and were recalled with him, according to the pleasure of the
Republic, which has full power over us. I do not conceive that our
friendship was in any way hurtful or dishonourable to you as can be
clearly demonstrated, and if obligations and benefits were weighed,
perhaps the scale would not be equal, although from what you write
you do not seem to think so. I always considered myself beholden to
you, but if you examine your conscience you will see that you have
exempted me from any obligations; nevertheless I am willing to remain
your debtor in so far as it touches me privately, but the public
injury I cannot, will not, and may not pardon. For myself personally I
forget everything, forgive all wrongs, and remain as a son ought to be
towards such a father.<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a></p>

<p>In 1466 Piero de’ Medici’s daughter Nannina was married to Bernardo
Rucellai, son of Giovanni, who built the beautiful palazzo Rucellai
after the designs of his friend Leon Battista Alberti. Giovanni spent
3686 golden florins on the festivities for his son’s wedding, and for
three days the Florentines danced, ate, drank and listened to music, in
Via della Vigna Nuova. The street, and the loggia (one of the few still
existing in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span> Florence), which was temporarily enlarged so as to cover
the small triangular square in front of the palace, were hung with blue
cloth and decorated with flowers. One of Nannina’s sons, Giovanni, is

<p>Several brides had been proposed for Lorenzo, and at last Piero decided
for a daughter of the proud house of Orsini. The suggestion was first
made by his brother-in-law Giovanni Tornabuoni, head of the Medici bank
at Rome, and treasurer to Sixtus IV. But Lucrezia insisted on seeing
the girl with her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span> own eyes before coming to a final decision, and in
March 1467 set out for Rome, from whence she wrote to her husband:</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Lucrezia de’ Medici</span> <i>to her husband</i> <span class="smcap">Piero</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>On the way I wrote to thee often and told thee about the roads. I
arrived on Thursday, and was received with much joy by Giovanni, as
thou canst imagine. I have had thy letter of the 21st which consoled
me greatly, hearing that the pains had ceased. But every day seems to
me a year until I return for thy and my consolation.</p>

<p>On the way to S. Peter on Thursday morning I met Madonna Maddalena
Orsini, sister to the Cardinal [Latino Orsini], with her daughter, who
is about fifteen or sixteen years old. She was dressed in the Roman
fashion with a <i>lenzuolo</i> [long loose shawl or cloak]. In this
dress she seemed to me handsome, fair, and tall, but being so covered
up I could not see her to my satisfaction. Yesterday I paid a visit
to the said Monsignor Orsini in his sister’s house, which adjoins
his. When I had saluted him in thy name his sister came in with the
maiden, who had on a tight frock of the fashion of Rome without the
<i>lenzuolo</i>. We talked for some time and I looked closely at the
girl. As I said she is of good height and has a nice complexion, her
manners are gentle, though not so winning as those of our girls, but
she is very modest and would soon learn our customs. She has not fair
hair, because here there are no fair women; her hair is reddish and
abundant, her face rather round, but it does not displease me. Her
throat is fairly elegant, but it seems to me a little meagre, or to
speak better, slight. Her bosom I could not see, as here the women
are entirely covered up, but it appeared to me of good proportions.
She does not carry her head proudly like our girls, but pokes it a
little forward; I think she was shy, indeed I see no fault in her
save shyness. Her hands are long and delicate. In short I think the
girl is much above the common, though<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span> she cannot compare with Maria,
Lucrezia, and Bianca.<a id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> Lorenzo has seen her and thou canst find
out whether she pleases him. Whatever thou and he determine will be
well done, and I shall be content. Let us leave the issue to God.</p>

<p>The girl’s father is Signor Jacopo Orsini of Monte Rotondo, and her
mother is the Cardinal’s sister. She has two brothers; one a soldier
in the good graces of Signor Orso, the other a priest, sub-deacon of
the Pope. They own the half of Monte Rotondo, the other half belongs
to their uncle, who has two sons and three daughters. Besides this
there are three other castles belonging to her brothers, and as far
as I can learn they are otherwise well provided. They will be still
better off in the future because besides the Cardinal, the Archbishop,
Napoleon, and the Cavalier, being their uncles on the mother’s side,
they are cousins through the father, who is a second cousin in direct
line of the aforesaid gentlemen, and they are all very fond of them.
This is what I have heard. If before treating this matter it seems
well to thee to await our return do as thou thinkest best.</p>

<p>I intend to leave on Monday week and shall write on the way. So I
shall be at home at the time fixed. I pray God in His mercy to guide
me safely and to keep thee in good health. I do not write to Madonna
Contessina, it seems to me useless. Commend me to her and salute the
girls and Lorenzo and Giuliano.—In Rome, 27th March 1467.</p>

<p>A few days later Lucrezia wrote again on the subject which engrossed
all her thoughts:</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Lucrezia de’ Medici</span> <i>to her husband</i> <span class="smcap">Piero</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>As I told thee in my last letter dictated to Giovanni, our seeing the
girl was managed quietly, without ceremony; so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span> should nothing come of
it thou wilt lose nought, as there has been no parleying. The maiden
has two good qualities, she is tall and fair; her face is not pretty,
but it is not common, and her figure is good. Lorenzo has seen her,
find out whether she pleases him, there are so many advantages that if
he likes her we may be content. Her name is Crarice.</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Thy Lucrezia.</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p>Like a true Florentine, Lucrezia turns the <i>l</i> in Clarice into an
<i>r</i>. Lorenzo had seen the girl without her mother’s knowledge one
day at mass. On the homeward journey Lucrezia writes in answer to a
letter from her husband:</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Lucrezia de’ Medici</span> <i>to her husband</i> <span class="smcap">Piero</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I have thy letter by Donnino and see the determination thou hast
taken, which pleases me. I am sure when I get home and tell thee all
thou wilt be well satisfied, particularly as Lorenzo is pleased. We
did not see the girl again, but that does not surprise me. Thou sayest
I write coldly about her: I do it not to raise thy hopes too high:
there is no handsomer girl at present unmarried in Florence. On my
return I will tell thee all, and as I said before we shall be able
to arrange matters, so at present I will say no more. I arrived here
very tired, the road was so bad, and we had so much rain that little
was left of me, but after resting I am well. We were to have left on
Monday, but it does nothing but rain, so they have persuaded me to
wait a little. All is ready, and as soon as the weather is favourable
we shall start, for it seems to me a thousand years since I left. I
commend myself unto thee.—April 1, 1467.</p>

<p>I know not, she writes, whether it is thanks to these doctors or to
thy letter received last night, but this morning I felt so well that
I hope to set forth in three days. Maestro Girolamo will tell thee
exactly the state of my health, which I think will content thee. I
only lament the many annoyances I have caused thee on my journey.
But believe me, wherever I might have been I should have been ill,
for I have brought up much phlegm and nastiness which must have been
there for a long time. Commend me to Mona Contessina and beg her to
have patience, for soon, as soon as it pleases these doctors, I shall
return to her and maybe she will take better care of me, though here,
thanks be to God, I have wanted for nothing. I know not whether I
should even have had such conveniences at home, certainly not at Rome.
If it seems good to thee that I should send back Messer Gentile for
Giuliano let me know before we start.<a id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> I shall wait to get quite

</div>

<p>After her return to Florence the doctors sent Lucrezia early in
September to Bagno a Morba, a place already mentioned in earlier
pages. But here, where several letters are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span> given written by Lucrezia
from that celebrated spring, a few words may be added on the bathing
habits of the fifteenth century to show how large a part they played
in the social life of the time. For it is a delusion to think that the
frequent use of water, cold or hot, is a modern virtue. It is true that
from the middle of the sixteenth century till the end of the eighteenth
men and women washed but sparingly. Marguerite de Valois could say to
her lover, “See these fair hands. Though they have not been washed
for eight days, they are cleaner than yours.” Manuals of Etiquette,
published in 1667 and in 1782, recommend ladies and gentlemen to clean
their faces with a dry white linen cloth, because to wash the face
with water makes it more susceptible to cold in winter and to tan in
summer. But in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries the use of water
was nearly as common as it is now. The whole population, whether north
or south of the Alps, rejoiced in bathing. They used cold baths, hot
baths, and steam baths; they gathered to bathe in mineral water; above
all they delighted in baths when the water came from hot springs, and
those were most prized which were strongly impregnated with sulphur,
as was the case at Morba. The site of many an Italian monastery was
selected simply because it was near enough a hot spring for the monks
to enjoy what was looked on almost as necessary to healthy living.
Indeed one of the punishments inflicted on unruly members of the
community was a prohibition to use the bath. The Italian doctors
distinguished between <i>Stupha</i>, or hot air, and <i>Balneum</i>,
or hot water baths. Rubbing and even scratching whilst bathing was
recommended, and Arnaldo di Villa Nuova (1300-1366) ordered his elderly
patients to be well rubbed when in the water, and to take a herb-bath
four times a month. Soap, and sometimes lye, was used, and Italian soap
was in great request, particularly in Germany.</p>

<p>The hot sulphur springs of Morba had been known for centuries, and
belonged to the Commune of Volterra, as is mentioned in a document of
1297. They lie some ten miles south of the old Etruscan city, in that
part of the Apennines dominated by the imposing Monte Cerbole, in a
region which then and now produced borax and alum. The wild desolate
scenery gave rise to legends. It was said that on stormy nights a fiery
chariot drawn by fiery horses rushes along the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span> mountain side, and then
with a terrific noise which drowns thunder and wind, dashes down into
the valley leading to the lagoons of Larderello, which were supposed
to be the mouths of hell, and disappears. After the apparition of the
chariot, the jets of white sulphureous smoke which always rise more or
less from the grey soil are more dense and hiss like great serpents as
they curl upwards to the sky. It is altogether an uncanny place. Here
and there the black mud bubbles and boils, rising up in small cones
which subside with a strange rumbling noise like the hoarse barking or
growling of a distant watchdog. The ground sounds hollow under foot,
and shakes if you walk near any of the blowholes, while the smell of
rotten eggs, so characteristic of sulphur springs, is overpowering,
particularly after rain.</p>

<p>The famous baths are not far off. They had been largely deserted,
conduits broken, bathing-houses tumbling down, everything neglected
and falling to ruin. The sulphureous springs, left to find their way
through the rocks and the soil, were wasted and produced nothing but
evil-smelling ooze. When the Florentines became masters of Volterra
they sent Doctor Ugolino da Montecatini with their Chancellor Colucci
da Salutati to report on the virtues of the waters in 1388. Something
was done to render the baths useful and productive. The village with
its small castle was rebuilt and surrounded with a sheltering wall.
Visitors were protected from the sudden assaults of the robber nobles
whose castles crowned neighbouring heights, and who swooped down on
the bathers in hopes of plunder and ransom. The baths regained some of
their old prosperity, and gouty or rheumatic Florentines braved the
discomforts of the road to make use of the waters. Cosimo Pater Patriæ
visited them frequently, and on a memorable occasion a favourite pair
of scissors were left in his lodgings, which Contessina tells her son
Giovanni to send back to Florence (p. <a href="#Page_55">55</a>). The probability is, however,
that the arrangements were anything but luxurious when Lucrezia first
tried and found the benefits of the healing springs.</p>

<p>She soon saw the advantages of the position, and after buying the
village and baths of Morba in 1477 from the Commune of Florence, in
true Florentine fashion at once made plans which would benefit the
place, its visitors, her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span> own health, and her pocket. The valuable
water was largely wasted; cisterns were needed; more springs might
be discovered. Accordingly experts were engaged, the ground was
investigated, and work was carefully planned. The known springs were
cleared, the water was carefully collected and brought into a great
covered cistern built of well-burnt bricks and covered with tiles
according to the most approved pattern of the day. Search was made for
other springs; the streamlets were followed back to their sources in
neighbouring rocks. Soon the supply of water was more than doubled.
Meanwhile the bathing-houses with their twelve separate baths were
rebuilt. Old engravings enable us to form some idea of these Italian
baths, which were made much more luxurious than those north of the
Alps. There is no trace of that promiscuous bathing so common in
Germany. Either the sexes had separate bathing-houses or, what is more
probable, used the same baths at different hours. We see a room with
one or more oblong baths set in the floor, and to each bathroom was
attached a smaller apartment with a bed for the hour of repose enjoined
after bathing. The bathing establishment was a long row of such
bathrooms completely separate from each other. At first the same stream
of water served all the baths at Morba, but it was found that those
nearest the cisterns were too hot, while those furthest from them were
too cold. The defect was remedied by an ingenious system of conduits.
Provision was made in each bathroom for shower or douche baths, the
water being conducted along the walls in open gutters pierced with
holes above each wooden tub. Lucrezia also built a large house which
served as an hotel and, as at Cauterets—the favourite bathing resort
of Marguerite d’Angoulême, the Queen of Navarre, where there was a
<i>Maison du Roi</i>, while the other bathers lived in <i>cabanes et
logis</i>—there was a “small palace” for her own use and that of her
family. It must have been a thorough holiday for the energetic and busy
woman, for, as the Queen of Navarre said, “while at the baths one must
live as free from care as a child.”</p>

<p>Lorenzo accompanied his mother to Morba, but there was a report which
seems to have been well founded, though Piero in his letter to her
treats it as an idle dream, that the Florentine exiles had resolved
to attack the place and capture both<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span> mother and son. So Lucrezia
invented some pretext to send him back to Florence, and the family
doctor prevented his return. It will be noticed that although children
in those days spoke of their parents by their Christian names, yet they
almost always wrote <i>voi</i> (you) in addressing them. Only husband
and wife and parents used the familiar <i>tu</i> (thou). <i>Lei</i>,
now universally used to all but near relations or great friends, is
never met with.</p>

<p>I thought I should have been with you by now, but the weather has
become much cooler, and Maestro Mariotti does not think it would be
good for my eczema to return there. Therefore I have determined not
to come. Piero has promised to go and see you either with Messer
Benedetto or soon afterwards. Let us find that you are so improved
in health that nothing more will be necessary. We are all well here,
particularly Piero, whose only need is to hear oftener about you; in

all dreams. From him and also from thy letter to Mona Contessina I
learn that thou art better, so I hope for thy complete recovery,
which is indeed certain. It cannot be otherwise after the prayers
and supplications which have been and are being made in places some
of which thou knowest, and in others which thou knowest not. But
what must be attributed to the grace of God is that prayers have
been made by those who know us not, and whom thou hast never known:
a wonderful thing truly, more divine than human, and I steadfastly
believe that owing to these prayers we shall receive grace from God:
but as thou in thy wisdom knoweth we shall remain deeply in debt. God
make us grateful and send us the power to satisfy all. Have faith
and be obedient to the doctors, do not depart one drachm from their
commands, submit and suffer all things, if not for thyself and for us,

you. I hope, thanks be to God, that this thing will conduce to the
well-being of your house and of ours, for it pleases us old people,
also the youth and the maiden, and indeed all. We should be glad to
see our nephew Lorenzo, or <i>saltem</i> his brother, at the feast of
the Nativity. We should give him a magnificent, a quiet, or a middling
reception, according to your wishes, for we only desire to please you
in this: and you may rest assured that all we have is at your disposal
and pleasure. Be careful, I beg of you, to keep well and joyful, thus
nought will be wanting to you or to us.—<i>Ex Urbe, die 26 Novembris
1468.</i></p>

<p><i>Magnifice vir, tanquam pater honorande, post commendationem</i>,
&amp;c.,—By Giovanni Tornabuoni I received your letter, and he has given
me the message from Your Magnificence. It pleases me mightily; I
do not think that in these times Your Magnificence could have done
better. I could not be better pleased or more gratified, considering
that it is for the benefit and the common good of all; therefore I
congratulate Your Magnificence. And that Your Magnificence may be
amply informed about everything, although I know you will hear all
from Giovanni, nevertheless it is my duty to tell you that this very
day, in the name of God, everything has been concluded. The reason why
the contract is not <i>per verba de presenti</i> is that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span> Monsignore
[Cardinal Orsini] does not wish it to be divulged, therefore we send
a sketch of the contract according to his desire; the one sent to us
was simple enough. Everything has been agreed to in the following
fashion, <i>videlicet</i>: That they give a dower of 6000 Roman
florins in money, jewels, and dresses; which they stipulate should
return to their heirs should she not have children or dispose of it by
will. They agree that you should not give her the fourth part of the
dower, as is customary here; and in this and all other matters, the
Florentine usage and custom is to be followed save in the restitution
of the dower if she dies <i>sine filiis et intestata</i>. Thus neither
the custom here nor the custom there will be absolutely adhered to,
so that both parties will be content. I have been present at all
the arrangements, and they seem to me honest and reasonable; for
you do not need her fortune, and your own remains to you. It is but
reasonable that they should have their way in something.</p>

<p>Magnificent Piero, I value the connection much, but they are even more
desirous and glad to be related to you. Of a truth their pleasure is
not to be described. This must be a satisfaction to you, and every
day, if it pleases God, you will be better satisfied, and we also; for
truly if I had a hundred tongues I could not tell Your Magnificence
how pleased I am. Send the contract soon, for it will be impossible to
keep this affair secret, as Pietro d’Arcangelo, chancellor of the Duke
of Urbino, has spoken of it, and these Pazzi have begun to spread the
news.</p>

<p>You have not sent the letters I asked Your Magnificence for; probably
because you had letters from the King to send here concerning the
affair about which I wrote. If you have them it would be well to send
them as I can assure Your Magnificence that if the friend takes up the
business I have good hopes of success. Whatever Your Magnificence does
in this and other matters about which I shall write will be well done,
as I am certain that Your Magnificence values my well-being<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span> and my
honour as much as I do myself. I commend myself to Your Magnificence,
<i>et quam Deus felicem conservet</i>.—Rome, November 27, 1468.

</p>

<p>I said above that I had good hopes if the letters are sent, not
because I rely on the benevolence of him who is to do the affair, but
because he, if he wishes to gain a place, must give his companion a
share, who will either do nothing or be obliged to act according to
the will of the other. But he has a great desire to succeed, and will
not give heed to what people say, and therefore will not care much
for those who may claim their share at any cost. The afore-mentioned
affair [the marriage] has not been announced yet to our Lord the
Pope, because it did not seem good to Monsignore to do so before the
contract is here.<a id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a></p>

<p>Francesco Tornabuoni, Lorenzo de’ Medici’s uncle, who together with
his brother Giovanni was in the Medici bank at Rome, did his best to
inspire his nephew with love for the girl suggested by Giovanni as his
bride by writing flowery descriptions of her.</p>

<p>Not a day passes that I do not see your Madonna Clarice, who has
bewitched me: she improves every day. She is beautiful, she has the
sweetest of manners and an admirable intelligence. It is about eight
days since she began to learn to dance, and each day she learns a
new one; no sooner is it shown her than she knows it. Master Agnolo
had begged her to write to you with her own hand, but nothing would
induce<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span> her to do so. Then I begged of her, and she said she would,
only she told me you were evidently extremely occupied with this
tournament; and then arrived Donnino who brought no letter from you.
As you cannot visit her in person at least write to her often, it
would give her great pleasure. Of a truth you have the most perfect
bride in Italy.—January 4, 1469.</p>

<p>Francesco’s letter had the desired effect, and Lorenzo wrote to his
bride. Unfortunately his letters are not to be found. Her answers are
touching in their girlish simplicity, but they show that Clarice,
brought up in strictly clerical surroundings, was not the woman to
captivate the brilliant, rather sceptical Lorenzo.</p>

<p>In the name of God, on the 16th day of February 1469.</p>

<p><i>Magnifice vir et maior honorandissime</i>,—This day letters from
Giovanni have come, saying how you jousted in the tournament,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span> and
that Your Magnificence was unhurt and had achieved great honour. As
soon as I heard the news, I went to tell your Madonna Clarice, and
took her a letter from Giovanni, which gave her more pleasure than I
can describe. For four days she has been sad by reason of her fear for
Your Magnificence in the tournament, she also had a slight headache;
as soon as she heard the news the headache disappeared and she was
quite merry. Of Madonna Maddalena [Orsini] I say nought, for it is
impossible to say how contented and happy she is; the only thing she
desires is that you should come here for Lent, for she says she wants
you to see your merchandise before you take it home: it improves every
day. Enclosed you will find a letter from her. Madonna Clarice would
not write, and she bids me say from her that she has a great secret
to tell you which she will entrust to no one, neither will she write
it for fear the letter should go astray. Indeed she longs to see you,
and now the tournament is over you have no valid excuse. She commends
herself to Your Magnificence, and to the Magnificent Piero and Madonna
Contessina, and to Bianca, Nannina, and Giuliano. I have bought some
purple cloth from London for a petticoat <i>a la romanesca</i>, which
will I think suit her; she intends to visit all the <i>perdoni</i>
(relics) to pray God for you.</p>

<p>Nought is talked of here but the splendour of the entertainment given
by you and especially of your own doings; they say no paladin ever
did more than Your Magnificence, and every one rejoices, particularly
your friends. Messer Giovanfrancesco, son of the Marquess of Mantua,
commends himself to Your Magnificence, and sends you many compliments.
I have no more to say at present save to commend myself to Your
Magnificence, praying that God may keep you from all ill.</p>

<p>The tournament of which Clarice writes was held on February 7, 1469,
in honour of the marriage of Lorenzo’s great friend, Braccio Martello,
and is recorded in a poem by Luigi Pulci.<a id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> It took place in the
Piazza S. Croce, and cost, as Lorenzo notes in his <i>Ricordi</i>,
10,000 ducats. This estimate, however, can only refer to the structures
and decorations in the Piazza S. Croce, and cannot include the money
expended on personal adornment. The dress of Giuliano alone, then
a handsome boy of fifteen, was said to have cost 80,000 ducats. It
was made of silver brocade strewn with pearls. Lorenzo’s, with its
jewels, must have cost a great deal more. He rode to the lists on a
magnificently caparisoned horse given to him by Ferrante, King of
Naples. Over his surcoat he wore a broad silk scarf, with fresh and
withered roses embroidered round his motto, <i>Le Tems Revient</i>,
written in pearls. In his black velvet cap studded with pearls was
a feather of gold filagree set with diamonds and rubies, and on his
shield were displayed the three golden lilies of France on an azure
ground, the privilege of bearing which was granted to his father Piero
in 1465 (see p. <a href="#Page_86">86</a>), while in the centre of the shield blazed the great
Medici diamond, <i>Il Libro</i>. In the Piazza he mounted a charger<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
presented to him by Borso d’Este, Duke of Ferrara, and buckled on
armour sent by the Duke of Milan. His prowess is celebrated by Luigi
Pulci as rivalling the deeds of Orlando and Achilles, and the first
prize, a helmet of silver with a figure of Mars, was assigned to him.
Lorenzo more modestly states that he was not well versed in the use of
weapons and the delivery of blows.</p>

<p>These Italian tournaments, which we read about so frequently as forming
part of the festivities attending weddings among the richer citizens of
Florence and other Italian towns, were more processions and pageants
than the rough-and-tumble feats of arms among northern nations. At one
of the tournaments held during the sitting of the Diet of Augsburg we
are told by a spectator that six competitors were killed: at another
that Ferdinand, King of the Romans, was thrown violently and his horse
rolled on him, endangering his life. We never hear of such accidents
attending the tame tournaments of Italy.</p>

that you emerged safe and unhurt; in which I think you were aided by
the prayers of your Clarice. Now I have been informed of the wishes
of the Magnificent Piero and your own as to Clarice’s journey to
Florence. Although I should have certainly desired, albeit I have not
been consulted, that your wishes should be followed in this matter,
always subordinate to those of Madonna our mother, who is very
sorrowful at her departure, yet it would only have been seemly if I,
as well as other people, had been written to about this business,
for you have no nearer relation here, nor one who is more desirous
to please you in this and in other matters. So when you want an
explanation or anything done, write openly to me and I shall do my
best to satisfy you. Say also to the Magnificent Piero that in future
he is not to apply to middle-men, for he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span> must dispose of me as he

<p>Lorenzo in his <i>Ricordi</i> writes: “I, Lorenzo, took to wife
Clarice, the daughter of Signor Jacopo Orsini, or rather she was given
to me (<i>i.e.</i> betrothed), in December 1468 and the marriage was
celebrated in our house on the 4th June 1469. Till now I have by her
two children, a daughter called Lucrezia ... years old, and a son
called Piero ... months old. King Ferrante is the godfather of the
girl. She is again with child. God spare her to us for a long time and
preserve her from all ill” (see p. <a href="#Page_153">153</a>).</p>

<p>The following description of Lorenzo de’ Medici’s wedding is taken from
a contemporary manuscript existing in Codex 574, Class xxv. of the
Strozziani MSS. in the National Library of Florence. There is no record
of the writer in the manuscript, but his name appears in the catalogue
of the Library as Piero di Marco Parenti, and it may be that it was
on the cover which is wanting. Born in Florence in January 18, 1450,
Parenti died in May 1519, and according to Moreni was the author of
several other works which still exist in manuscript in the Library. The
name of the person to whom the letter was written does not appear, but
from people mentioned, and other indications, he may have been Filippo
di Matteo Strozzi, the builder of the fine Palazzo Strozzi in Florence,
who was then in Naples.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>On Friday, which was the 2nd of June, the presents offered by the
countryside began to arrive from the principal towns, Pisa, Arezzo,
and other communes, villas, and castles. All presented eatables, such
as calves, fowls, geese, wine, sweetmeats, wax, and fish. I send you
the exact list as far as I could get it. The presentations of these
went on all day on Saturday with great noise and rejoicings: and on
that day pieces of veal of from 10 to 20 lbs. in weight were given to
800 citizens. You and I were among the number.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Calves, 150.</p>

<p>More than 2000 couples of capons, geese, and fowls.</p>

<p>Sea fish and trout in large quantities. I do not yet know how many.</p>

<p>Sweet things in abundance; sugar-plums as big as arbutus berries,
almonds, pine-seeds, sweetmeats, also the imitations thereof from
there [Naples?]. The number I do not yet know.</p>

<p>Wax I know not how much.</p>

<p>Many hundreds of flasks of wine and several casks of foreign wines,
such as malvasy and the like, and of native red wine.</p>

<p>Of corn, oats, and the like, I do not think there was much.</p>
</div>

<p>On Sunday morning the bride left the house of Benedetto degl’
Alessandri on the big horse given to Lorenzo by the King [of Naples],
preceded by many trumpeters and fifers, and surrounded by the
youths usually in attendance on marriage festivities, well clothed.
Behind her came two cavaliers, Messer Carlo and Messer Tommaso, on
horseback with their retainers, who according to the usage of the city
accompanied her to her husband’s house which was most sumptuously
adorned, and where a stage had been erected in the street for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
dancing. As she dismounted the bride’s retinue arrived from the house
of the Alessandri: thirty young matrons and maidens most richly
dressed, and among them was your Fiammetta, one of the two handsomest
there. They were accompanied by another set of youths dressed for
dancing and preceded by trumpeters. Thirty other maidens were in
Lorenzo’s house to receive the bride and her retinue. After the olive
tree, to the sound of much music, had been hauled up to the windows,
all went to dinner. The tree was arranged in a vase like those used on
the triumphal cars for the feast of S. Giovanni and was almost like a
<i>trionfo</i>.</p>

<p>The order of the banquets, of which there were five, was alike on the
mornings of Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday.</p>

<p>The bride, with about fifty maidens who were the dancers, ate in the
garden under the loggia which you know, and the tables were set at
the sides as far as the doors, one of which leads into the house,
the other outside. In the loggia which surrounds the courtyard of
the house sat the citizens who had been invited. The tables were
placed on three sides, beginning from the garden, and following the
wall were six tables: here sat from seventy to eighty citizens. In
the ground-floor hall the youths who danced, about thirty-two or
thirty-six, were seated. Forty or more men of more mature age were
occupied in marshalling the banquet, and at every table were two who
acted as seneschals. On a balcony in the great room upstairs dined
the women of a certain age, among them was your mother-in-law Monna
Antonia, and like her were about forty others in the company of Monna
Lucrezia. In short, at the principal tables dined about two hundred
people.</p>

<p>The order observed in serving was marvellous. For all the dishes were
brought in at the door opening into the street, preceded, as is the
custom, by trumpets. The bearers turned to the right in the loggia
and returned to the foot of the staircase up which some went, while
others passed into the hall to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span> the youths, and others to the maidens
in the garden, and others again remained under the loggie where were
those who had been invited, so that all were served at the same time.
The like order was observed in taking away the dishes, and each man
knew his service and his place and did nought else. The dishes were
according to the tables, and among those who brought them in were the
stewards, each of whom directed his own men to the proper table. There
were fifty large dishes, the contents of each of which were sufficient
to fill two trenchers, and one trencher was placed between every two
guests, a carver being in attendance.</p>

<p>The banquets were prepared for a marriage rather than for a
magnificent feast, and I think this was done <i>de industria</i> as an
example to others not to exceed the modesty and simplicity suitable
to marriages, so there was never more than one roast. In the morning
a small dish, then some boiled meat, then a roast, after that wafers,
marzipan and sugared almonds and pine-seeds, then jars of preserved
pine-seeds and sweetmeats. In the evening jelly, a roast, fritters,
wafers, almonds, and jars of sweetmeats. On Tuesday morning, instead
of the roast were sweet pies of succulent vegetables on trenchers; the
wines were excellent malvasy, trebbiano,<a id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> and red wine. Of silver
plate there was little.</p>

<p>No sideboards had been placed for the silver. Only tall tables in the
middle of the courtyard, round that handsome column on which stands
the David,<a id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> covered with tablecloths, and at the four corners were
four great copper basins for the glasses, and behind the tables stood
men to hand wine or water to those who served the guests. The same
arrangement was made in the garden round the fountain you know. On the
tables were silver vessels in which the glasses were put to be kept
cool. The salt-cellars, forks, knife-handles, bowls for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span> fritters,
almonds, sugar-plums, and the jars for preserved pine-seeds were of
silver; there was none other for the guests save the basins and jugs
for washing of hands. The tablecloths were of the finest white damask
linen<a id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> laid according to our fashion.</p>

<p>About four hundred citizens were invited to these five banquets, and
among them the first of your house was your Lorenzo, and then Agnolo
and Lodovico; I was also there.</p>

<p>On Monday morning to all who had received veal, jelly was given,
and then about 1500 trenchers full were presented to others. Many
religious [monks and nuns] also received gifts of fowls, fish,
sweetmeats, wine, and similar things.</p>

<p>After the guests at the first tables had finished many hundreds ate.
They say that between the house here and that of Messer Carlo<a id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a>
more than a thousand people ate, and at Messer Carlo’s every day one
hundred barrels of wine were drunk.</p>

<p>In the house here, where the marriage feast was, every respectable
person who came in was at once taken to the ground-floor hall, out of
the large loggia, to refresh himself with fruit, sweetmeats, and white
and red wine. The common folk were not invited.</p>

<p>The feasting began in the morning a little before dinner-time, then
every one went away to repose. At about the twentieth hour (4 o’clock)
they returned and danced until supper-time on the stage outside, which
was decorated with tapestries, benches, and forms, and covered in with
large curtains of purple, green, and white cloth, embroidered with
the arms of the Medici and the Orsini. Every time a company came on
to the stage to dance they took refreshments once or twice, according
to the time. First came the trumpeters, then a great silver basin,
then many smaller ones full of glasses, then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span> small silver jars full
of water, then many flasks of trebbiano and then twenty-three silver
bowls full of preserved pine-seeds and sweet conserves. To all was
given in abundance and all the dishes were emptied; and the same with
the flasks of wine. The account has not been made, but from five to
... thousand pounds of sweetmeats and sugar-plums were consumed.</p>

<p>The bride has received about fifty rings, costing they say from ten to
fifty or sixty ducats each; one piece of brocade; a sweetmeat dish of
silver, and many other such things; and a small book of the offices
of Our Lady, most beautiful, the gift of Messer Gentile,<a id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> written
in letters of gold on blue vellum and covered with crystal and worked
silver, which cost about two hundred florins. On Tuesday the bride
left (a tournament was held first), and returned to the house of the
Alessandri in the same dress in which she came to be married. This
was a robe of white and gold brocade and a magnificent hood on her
head, as is used here. She rode the same horse and was accompanied
by the same youths, whose rich dresses of silver brocade embroidered
with large pearls and jewels baffle description. From what they tell
of courts of great princes nothing was ever seen like it save certain
jewels of great value worn by some great Lords. Of the women I say
nothing! Such jackets and robes of silk, all of them embroidered with
pearls. I rather blame than praise this height of civilisation. And
thus ended this marriage.</p>

<p>One day it rained; on the Monday, just when the feast was at its
highest. It seemed as though done on purpose. It enveloped everything
and wet the beautiful dresses, for the rain was so sudden and so heavy
that many could not get under shelter soon enough. But the youths and
the women had not put on the finest clothes which they had reserved
for that day, the most important of the feast, so that to many it
seemed their money had been spent in vain, not being able to wear<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>
them. However, on Tuesday morning when the bride went to hear mass in
S. Lorenzo, accompanied by all the youths and maidens who had attended
her at the wedding, every one was in their finest clothes. I warrant
you that there were about fifty maidens and young girls and as many or
more youths, so richly dressed that I do not think that anywhere among
so many people could such a splendid and fine spectacle be seen.</p>

<p>I know that though I have written you many things and in much detail
there is much still to be said; and although it is not worth your
reading or my writing, yet I have done so for your information, as I
know you to be curious, and that you like to know exactly how things
went. So I have written thus thinking it would please you better than
a more serious style.<a id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a></p>

<p><i>Magnifice et Prestantissime Pater honorande</i>,—I have not
written to Your Magnificence in these last days about the affair at
Rimini, because I was sure you would hear of it from diverse sides,
and that the Illustrious League would take proper steps. But as I
neither see nor hear that the Illustrious League has made any sign of
life and considering the great injury to us, to the friends of the
League, and to yourself, which will be occasioned in the future, I
am moved to note it and to impart my thoughts to Your Magnificence;
although I do not esteem myself of sufficient capacity to write such
notes. But anxiety, and devotion to the Illustrious League, and the
love I bear Your Magnificence induce me to warn you. I have also
written this my opinion to H.E. the Duke, and should have done the
same to H.M. the King, only the road is long and our messengers pass
with difficulty; also I thought Your Magnificence would have sent the
news from there. Your Magnificence must have heard that the Signoria
of Venice has again made an alliance with our Lord the Pope, <i>et
inter alia</i> has promised to send, whenever he demands them, 4000
horse and 3000 foot-soldiers into Romagna. From good authority I hear
that the Pope has just asked for them, and that the Signoria is arming
them and has ordered His Magnificence Ercole [Duke of Ferrara], the
Lords of Carpi and of Mirandola, to hold themselves in readiness to
march; and that yesterday they were to receive their pay. Also I hear
that bridges are being thrown across the Po near Ravenna, for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>
passage of the troops of the Signoria of Venice, and that the picked
squadrons and Antonello da la Corna were advancing to meet these
others. What all these preparations mean I leave to the judgment of
Your Magnificence. I can only imagine that the Pope and the Signoria
of Venice intend to occupy Arimino and the rest of Romagna and then
Bologna. Should Rimini fall this will probably happen, and where
Bologna and Imola would be Your Magnificence and the League may, like
prudent men, calculate. He who does not put a stop to such beginnings
will spend a hundred instead of one, and God grant things may go
well. I therefore beg and entreat Your Magnificence to succour little
Arimino in order that the wound may not fester and increase in such
wise that none can heal it. The Illustrious League must not allow its
friends to lose courage and faith, else the end will be our perdition.
To me it seems this is not a moment for losing time. Your Magnificence
must remember that the Pope and the Signoria of Venice have been
preparing this for a long time, otherwise the Pope would not have
spent so much money, a thing quite against his nature. Had the move
been only against Arimino; but it is more especially against Bologna
and the rest of Romagna, and more considerable events may follow. I
commend myself to Your Magnificence.—June 17, 1469.</p>

<p>A few weeks after his wedding Lorenzo had to leave his bride and
undertake an embassy to Milan. A son had been born on June 20th to
Galeazzo, Duke of Milan, and Piero de’ Medici was asked to stand
sponsor to the child. He was too ill to travel, and “somewhat
unwillingly,” he confesses, sent Lorenzo to act as his proxy. The
embassy went by Prato, Pistoja, Lucca, and Pietrasanta to Sarzana,
which town and district had been recently purchased by Pietro and
added to the Florentine dominions. Thence the company travelled by
Pontremoli to Milan. The preparations for the journey were evidently
on too magnificent a scale to please the cautious father, and we find
him complaining to his wife Lucrezia in a less affectionate tone than
usual. The following three letters refer to the journey. To it also
belongs the passage in Lorenzo’s <i>Ricordi</i> or memoranda, in which
he states that Sforza proposed that he should stand godfather to all
his other children.</p>

Herewith I repeat that they must be here this evening and start

in some other way. Meanwhile see that everything is ready, and tell
Lorenzo that he is not to exceed his orders, or to make any great

<p>Your Magnificence commanded me to send you news of your Magnificent
Lorenzo every eight days. I now begin to recount the first week.
As you will have heard from Francesco Nori and Gugliemo de’ Pazzi,
after leaving you in the early morning we arrived at Prato during
the cool. He dined with the Protonotary of the Medici, together with
the Podestà of the place, his own people and Giuliano. There was
some wind when we left about the 20th hour [4 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>], and he
reached Pistoja on Friday evening, being met by several citizens of
the town. He dismounted at the Bishop’s palace, as a messenger had
said that Monsignore expected him. Having saluted the Bishop he went,
while the luggage was being unloaded, to visit the two governors
(<i>Rettori</i>), the Captain and the Podestà of the town, who were
all invited by the Bishop to keep him company at supper. Four citizens
came on behalf of the Priors to excuse themselves in the name of the
townspeople, that on account of his unexpected arrival they had not,
&amp;c. &amp;c., and begged him with affectionate words that on his return,
&amp;c. On Saturday he mounted at nine in the morning, and dined at
Pescia with the governor, Baptista Nasi, there being no better inn;
the heads of the Commune came to pay their respects, and presented
wine, marzipan (cakes made with sweet almonds), and corn, and some
private citizens did the same. After resting in the house of the Grand
Master of Altopascio, who had accompanied him for dinner, he left at
20 of the clock, and met several chief citizens who had come to do
him honour in their houses. Passing through Lucca at 23 of the clock,
he dismounted at the inn della Corona,<a id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> outside the town on the
Pisan road, intending to leave the next morning (Sunday). But after
supper came six citizens of Lucca, with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span> torches and servants of the
Signoria, and finding Lorenzo on the square in the cool receiving
visits from private acquaintances Paolo Trenta and Piero Guidiccioni
addressed him, complaining that he had not deigned to dismount in a
city where he was so welcome and had such influence, but had gone
outside, and then in a long oration they prayed him to wait until
the Signoria had, &amp;c. &amp;c. Lorenzo replied that to see them, whom he
reverenced as fathers, gave him patience to undertake these visits,
and perceiving that he was expected to reply in person he would put
off his departure until after dinner, and next morning would come
and demonstrate his affection towards the Signoria. Messer Niccolò
da Noceto, Paolo di Poggio, and many other citizens came on Sunday
morning to fetch him, and placing him first in their midst, and then
Bernardo Rucellai, and then the Chancellor, they accompanied him to
mass in the chapel of the Volto Santo, and then to the Signoria,
where he spoke so fluently and so well that he drew to himself the
hearts of all the people. When he returned presents began to arrive,
torches, large and small, marzipan, boxes of sweetmeats, and wine. He
thanked, bestowed gifts, kept a few of the gentlemen to dinner, spread
out his silver, and as some showed symptoms of moving the wind having
risen, he left before the time fixed; yet many of the citizens rode
after him, and insisted on accompanying him and talking much. On the
way he rested at Chiesa, Mazzarosa, and <a id="capezzano"></a>Capezzano, all very pretty
places. At Pietrasanta he arrived at 23 of the clock, and lodged at
the inn of the Campana outside, for it is an untrustworthy town; S.
George had not much faith in S. Zita.<a id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> But the governor, who is
a gentleman from Fiesco, sent to offer to pay his respects, and to
do anything in his power. He saw him, thanked, and then, accompanied
by all those men who could not take their eyes off him, supped with
some of the citizens under an arbour; the place is beautiful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span> with
the sea in front and fertile plains behind. At 8 of the clock he
mounted and rode sixteen miles most gaily. Under Monte Tignoso he met
an envoy of the Magnificent Marquess of Fosdinovo, who invited him in
the name of his master, and at Lavenza, or a little before reaching
Luni, the Marquess Gabriello himself, who conducted him to his house
at Sarzana. On dismounting he visited the governor who rules here
for the Florentines, then we dined, and after resting a little went
to see Sarzanella, which seen from the castle seemed to him a good
purchase.<a id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> When he had supped he went to visit Messer Francesco,
ducal Cameriere, who lives out of the town, and finding him ill
provided for supper, he supplied him bountifully. To-morrow he goes to
dine at Villa Franca, and in the evening will be at Pontremoli. The
journey has been so arranged that he will be at Milan on Saturday, and
after fulfilling his Magnificent father’s commission he will return
at once to you who are the only one he regrets being absent from. He
is very well and gay, and so is Bernardo.<a id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> Tell Nannina this. Our
party is as when we left all good friends and obedient; we have had
no drawbacks, for not even a nail is wanting. We have had no delays
or frauds. All goes well and happily: please God we shall find you
the same, to whom we all commend ourselves.—The 18th day of July

<p>In Lorenzo’s <i>Ricordi</i> he writes: “In the month of July
<span class="allsmcap">MCDLXIX</span> I went to Milan at the request of the most illustrious
Duke Galeazzo to stand godfather, as proxy for Piero our father, to his
first-born child. I was received with much honour, more so than the
others who came for the same purpose, although they were persons more
worthy than I. We paid our duty to the Duchess by presenting her with
a necklace of gold with a large diamond, which cost near 2000 ducats.
The consequence was that the said Lord desired that I should stand
godfather to all his children.”<a id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a></p>

Lordship’s orders. You will see what I write to Sagromora about being
careful of your own person, so that nothing unforeseen should happen.
It is well to give ear to all, though I do not think the danger is as
great as it seems. Still it is better to be prudent, and to imagine
danger may be greater than it really is.</p>

<p>In the autumn of 1469 Piero de’ Medici was very ill, partly no doubt
from anxiety about the state of Florence, “grievously troubled by
her own citizens.” He summoned the chief burghers to his bedside,
reproached them in the bitter words cited by Machiavelli, and
threatened that he would cause them to repent. Fair words in plenty
they gave him, but never changed their evil courses. “Whereupon,”
continues Machiavelli, “Piero called Agnolo Acciaiuoli secretly to
Caffagiuolo and conferred at length with him about the condition of
the city. There is no doubt that had he not been prevented by death he
would have reinstated all those who had been banished in order to put a
stop to the robbery of the others. But death put an end to these most
praiseworthy intentions. Tormented by increasing infirmity and anguish
of mind, he died in the fifty-third year of his age. His country could
not fully recognise his worth and his goodness, because until nearly
the end of his life he was associated with his father Cosimo, and the
few years during which he survived him were passed in civil contests
and constant illness.” Piero died at Careggi on December 2, 1469, and
was buried in S. Lorenzo, near his father.</p>

Medici, di Dante e d’altri</i>. The famous letter begins on page 71
(really 142, as only the right-hand page is numbered) and above it is
written in a different and more modern hand in red ink, <i>Epistola
di M. Angelo Poliziano al S. Federigo insieme con raccolto volgare

names of the various poets in the margin of the letter where they
are mentioned in red ink. The Life of Dante by Boccaccio and many
of the poems that are in the Palatina Codex are wanting. At page 78
(<i>i.e.</i> 156) the handwriting changes, and at the end of the
volume is inserted a Latin autograph letter from Poliziano to Philippu
Beroaldus. In 1814 the Abbate Vincenzo Nannucci and Luigi Ciampolini
published a collection of Poliziano’s poems and at the end printed
Lorenzo’s letter, attributing it to Poliziano. They were evidently
misled by the anonymous annotator of this codex. The attribution to
Poliziano is absurd, as he was then barely fourteen years of age, and
only knew Lorenzo in 1470, when he sent him a translation of part of
the Iliad (see p. <a href="#Page_157">157</a>).</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_102" href="#FNanchor_102" class="label">[102]</a> Luigi Pulci was born in Florence on August 15, 1432, of
Jacopo Pulci and Brigida de’ Bardi. His brothers Luca and Bernardo were
also poets. and Bernardo’s wife Antonia was a poetess of some repute.
Luca went into trade but failed, and died in gaol in 1470, leaving his
widow and children dependent on his brothers. Luigi, an intimate friend
of the Medici family, wrote <i>La Giostra</i> (sometimes attributed
to his brother Luca) to celebrate the tournament held by Lorenzo de’
Medici in honour of the marriage of Braccio Martelli, but really of
Lucrezia Donati just before his marriage with Clarice Orsini. The poem
<i>Driades</i> was first published under the pseudonym of Lucio Pulcro
in Florence in 1479, but the later editions bear his name. His greatest
work, less read than it deserves, <i>Morgante Maggiore</i>, was, as
Mr. Armstrong says, a growth rather than a composition. Stanzas were
recited at table, and Lucrezia de’ Medici urged him to collect them
into an epic poem. Besides being a poet, Luigi Pulci was an acute and
clever politician, often employed by Lorenzo in missions to foreign
courts. He died in 1484, probably at Padua whilst on the road to
Venice.</p>

dictates of policy, his views as to which were stated in an appeal
to Pietro de’ Medici on behalf of Rimini, in words which may almost
be deemed prophetic. ‘I am constrained to believe that the Pontiff
and the Venetian Signory intend to occupy Rimini and all Romagna, and
eventually Bologna too. Rimini once lost, the rest will readily follow,
and your lordship and the league may easily suppose where Bologna and
Imola would then be. Those who will not resist such projects at first
may have afterwards to pay a hundredfold, and God grant that it be to
good purpose.’” Edited by Edward Hutton. John Lane, London, 1909.</p>

</div>

<p class="center">(1450-1492)</p>


<p>Lorenzo de’ Medici, whose wonderful personality still has the power
to excite bitter hatred and an almost passionate admiration, was
a marvellously many-sided man. Marsilio Ficino said he possessed
the three endowments called “graces” by Orpheus, splendour,
light-heartedness, and rejuvenescence—splendour of intellect,
light-heartedness in resolution, and a continual renewal of youth in
person and in fortune. He was not twenty-one when his father died,
worn out by bodily suffering, but Lorenzo had been his right hand for
years, had been sent to represent him at foreign courts, and had seen
more of the world than most men of double his age. He and his younger
brother Giuliano received the education of princes rather than of the
sons of a merchant. Gentile Becchi of Urbino, a man of unblemished
life and considerable learning, was their tutor, Landino taught them
Italian literature, Argyropoulos Greek, and Marsilio Ficino Platonic
philosophy. They had also evidently been taught good manners, as Cambi,
who never misses an opportunity to decry the Medici, tells us that when
Lorenzo was with a citizen older than himself he always gave him the
place of honour on his right. Above all, the two lads had the example
and the teaching of their mother Lucrezia, a woman of strong good sense
and genuine piety, who possessed a sunny nature, that rare gift humour,
and a marked poetical temperament. From early childhood she sent
Lorenzo to the meetings of the confraternity of S. Paolo, where men
met for vigil and prayer, and after the services Messer Gentile by her
orders made him distribute alms to the poor. When the boy was thirteen
Gentile wrote to his father: “Lorenzo is well, your absence is ever
before him. We are well advanced in Ovid and also in Justinian, four
books of history and fables. You need not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span> ask how he delights in these
studies. His conduct is excellent, and he is very obedient.”</p>

<p>After Piero’s death Lucrezia, who had always been her husband’s trusted
helpmate, became the counsellor to whom Lorenzo turned for help,
consolation, and advice. He also had the good fortune to have a wise
and capable man by his side, Tommaso Soderini, husband of his mother’s
sister, Dianora Tornabuoni. Soderini’s influence was considerable, and
he used it to induce his fellow-citizens to confirm Lorenzo in the
pre-eminent though entirely unofficial position held by his grandfather
and his father. There was hardly a dissentient voice when the chief
citizens of Florence came to the Medici palace and begged him to take
charge of the city as they had done.</p>

<p>Niccolò Valori describes Lorenzo as “above the common stature, with
broad shoulders, solidly built, robust, and second to none in agility.
Although nature had acted towards him like a stepmother with regard
to his personal appearance, in all things connected with the mind she
had been a loving mother. His complexion was swarthy, and although
his face was not handsome, it was so full of dignity as to command
respect. He was short-sighted, his nose was flattened, and he had no
sense of smell. This did not trouble him. He was wont to say that he
was grateful to nature, disagreeable things being more common than
agreeable ones to so delicate a sense.”</p>

<p>Lorenzo was much inferior to his grandfather Cosimo in commercial
talent, but he was a genius, and as Symonds writes, “possessed of
one of those rare natures, fitted to comprehend all knowledge and to
sympathise with the most diverse forms of life. While he never for a
moment relaxed his hold on politics, among philosophers he passed as
a sage, among men of letters for an original and graceful poet, among
scholars for a Grecian, sensitive to every nicety of Attic idiom, among
artists for an amateur gifted with refined discernment and consummate
taste. Pleasure-seekers knew in him the libertine, who jousted with the
boldest, danced and masqueraded with the merriest, sought adventures in
the streets at night, and joined the people in their May-day games and
Carnival festivities. The pious extolled him as an author of devotional
lauds and mystery plays, a profound theologian, a critic of sermons.
He was no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span> less famous for his jokes and repartees than for his pithy
apothegms and maxims, as good a judge of cattle as of statues, as much
at home in the bosom of his family as in the riot of an orgy, as ready
to discourse on Plato as to plan a campaign or to plot the death of a
dangerous citizen.”<a id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a></p>

<p>A philosopher, a diplomatist, a “Pagan much inclined to the worship
of Venus,” as Machiavelli tells us, a Christian as shown in his
<i>Laudi</i> and his <i>Capitoli</i>, evidently written <i>con
amore</i>, a staunch friend, generous and kind, yet he is generally
accused of having ordered the sack of Volterra—now, however, proved to
have been instigated by the mercenaries engaged to defend the town—and
of causing his opponents to be tortured and executed. The indelible
stain on Lorenzo’s fair name is his interference with the deposits in
the <i>Monte</i>.<a id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> Cambi, who it must be remembered was no friend
of the Medici, writes: “On the 13th August 1490 seventeen so-called
Reformers were created by the authority of the Signory, the Colleges of
the Council, of the People, and of the Commune, the Council of the One
Hundred, the officers of the <i>Monte</i>, and the whole <i>Popolo</i>
of Florence. Under pretext of revising the coinage and the duties they
altered the entries of all monies received for the use of the State for
the benefit of Lorenzo de’ Medici, who needed money in order to make
his son Messer Giovanni a cardinal, which he did. And it was done with
the money of the Commune. Counting what they gave him after he became
a cardinal, it cost the Commune 10,000 scudi in gold. From the poor
dowers of the married maidens and of those about to be married they
deducted by means of taxes and the reduction of all future interest
3/4 per cent. of the interest, so that what should have given 3 per
cent. they lowered to 1-1/2 per cent., and even that was not paid....
Thus few maidens married, and those few only by dint of money. Even
then the permission of Lorenzo de’ Medici was necessary. Let every one
therefore<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span> consider what it means to create tyrants in the city, to
make a Balia and to call a parliament.”<a id="FNanchor_152" href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a></p>

<p>It was fortunate for the Italian language that the young Lorenzo fell
under the influence of Leon Battista Alberti, who asserted that “though
the ancient tongue has undisputed authority because so many learned
men have employed it, the like honour will certainly be paid to our
language to-day if men of culture take the pains to purify and polish
it.” The revival of classical learning had almost arrested the study
of Italian. In spite of the example of Dante and Boccaccio, Latin was
the patrician and literary language, and even when men of letters used
the vulgar tongue they interlarded it with Latin. Poliziano’s letters
are a case in point. The example of Lorenzo altered all this. In his
letter to Federigo of Naples (p. <a href="#Page_88">88</a>) he passes extraordinarily acute
criticism on the old Italian poets, and in his Commentary, which takes
up ninety-three double pages in the Aldine edition of his poems, he
predicts a glorious future to the language used by Dante, Cavalcanti,
Petrarch, and Boccaccio. “Men and practice,” he says, “have rather
been wanting to the language than the language to the men.” Muratori,
treating of the poetry of the fifteenth century, gives the palm to
Lorenzo, and Carducci declares him to be little if at all inferior to
Poliziano and Pulci.</p>

<p>Incessantly occupied in preserving the balance of power in Italy, yet
in his short life of forty-two years he wrote an amount of poetry,
and good poetry, which would do credit to a man whose whole life is
dedicated to literature. Treated as an equal by popes and princes—the
King of France doffed his cap to his ambassadors and called him “my
beloved cousin”—he was at home with the artisan and the peasant,
whose tastes he to a certain degree shared, and whose characters he so
perfectly understood and describes. In <i>La Nencia da Barberino</i>,
that gayest of gay poems overflowing with <i>la joie de vivre</i>,
often imitated but never surpassed, Vallera, the shy love-sick peasant,
sings the praises of his Nencia, who, with her pretty ways and soft
words, her eyes as black as coal, and her fair curly hair, would bear
away the palm among a thousand city maidens. Such a dancer too. She
bounds like a young goat, whirls like the wheel of a mill and then
curtsies, no Florentine lady can<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span> do it better. He offers to buy her a
paper cornet full of rouge or powder, or pins, or a necklace of those
little red buttons [coral] when he goes to Florence, for he would draw
the marrow from his bones to give her pleasure. Could he put his heart
into her hands it would cry “<i>Nencia, Nencia bella</i>,” if she cut
it with a knife. But Nencia flirts with other swains, his sighs are
full of tears, he waits for her to come with her sheep when he drives
his heifers to pasture, and the cruel girl turns back.<a id="FNanchor_153" href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a></p>

<p>Lorenzo’s love of the country, of country life, and of animals, is
shown in <i>Ambra</i> and <i>La Caccia col Falcone</i>. The former is
an allegorical description of a flood which swept away an island at
Lorenzo’s favourite villa, Poggio a Caiano. Winter is approaching. Only
the bay, the myrtle, and the prickly juniper, shine among the bare
trees, while the few birds take refuge in the cypresses. The olives
on a southern slope sway, now green now silver white, to the breeze.
The cranes print varied and beautiful lines on the sky, and Lorenzo
notes how the leader cedes his place, when tired, to one of those in
the rear. The eagle slowly circles in the air, a menace to all smaller
fowl. Zephyr has fled to Cyprus, where he dances with the lazy flowers
among the green grass. Boreas drives the mists down from the Alps,
and the river, writhing like a serpent in the valley, gathers his
tributaries. With strange sounds he rises. The yellow foam is tossed
into the air as the wicked turbid stream rolls stone upon stone, and
dashing against the dykes, overwhelms Ambra, “beloved of Lorenzo.”
The terrified peasants take refuge on the roofs of their cottages,
and watch their poor riches being swept away. Then comes the more
artificial and well-worn tale of the lovely nymph Ambra pursued by the
river god Ombrone, her prayer to the chaste goddess, and her farewell
to Lorenzo as she is turned to stone.</p>

<p><i>La Caccia col Falcone</i> is a graphic account of the sport<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span> Lorenzo
loved. Falcons, dogs, and men are drawn with facile pen by a man who
delighted in country life and open air.</p>

<p><i>Selve d’Amore</i> is a lover’s complaint on the absence of his lady.
Jealousy, Hope, and the Age of Gold, which existed before the opening
of Pandora’s box, are described. He invokes his mistress in these
beautiful lines beginning:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“O vaghi occhi amorosi,”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>and at last she appears, Beauty on her right hand, Love on her left.</p>

<p>This is, however, not the place to describe Lorenzo’s poems, the
fine <i>Altercazione</i>, a Platonic dialogue; the <i>Capitoli</i>,
or <i>I Beoni</i>. His <i>Ballate</i>, <i>Canzone di Ballo</i>, and
<i>Canzone Carnescialeschi</i>, which represent the popular, often
very licentious poetry of the streets, are known to all Italian
scholars. Il Lasca (A. Grazzini), after describing the masqueraders
parading the streets with <i>Trionfi</i>, allegorical or mythological
cars, and <i>Carri</i> filled with men representing various trades,
each one preceded and followed by its special attendants singing and
dancing, and many masqued horsemen, says: “The Magnificent Lorenzo
invented this manner of celebrating the festival. Formerly men dressed
up as women went about the streets singing and dancing, imitating the
maidens who thus greeted the month of May. The Magnificent, finding
it was always the same thing, imagined to change not only the songs
but the whole representation and the words, writing songs with varied
metres, and causing new and different airs to be written. The first
of these masquerades was performed by men who sold sugar-plums and
<i>berriquocoli</i> (small cakes), and the music, for three voices,
was written by a certain Arrigo Tedesco,<a id="FNanchor_154" href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> head of the choir of S.
Giovanni, a musician of great repute in those days.”</p>

<p>The most beautiful of Lorenzo’s carnival songs is <i>Il Trionfo di
Bacco e Arianne</i>, beginning:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Quant’ è bella giovanezza</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Che si fugge tuttavia.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Lorenzo’s sonnets are many, and some are worthy to rank with those of
the most famous poets; indeed Muratori, in the specimens<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span> of perfect
poetry appended to his treatise, cites four of them, together with the
finest of Dante, Cavalcanti, Petrarch, and other great poets. In the
<i>Laudi</i>, and the sacred play <i>S. Giovanni e Paolo</i>, can be
traced Lorenzo’s early bringing up under his mother, herself no mean
poetess, and the good Bishop Gentile. The play was written in later
life for his children who acted it. It is said that Lorenzo himself
took the part of Constantine. Already ill, and oppressed with cares,
the Emperor’s address to his sons describing the duties of a ruler, and
the lines</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Spesso chi chiama Costantin felice</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Sta meglio assai di me e’l ver non dice,”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>have a sad autobiographical ring.</p>

<p>Lorenzo, the one great statesman of Italy, had no easy part to play.
As prudent as he was dexterous, the preservation of peace in Italy
was his constant aim, to be attained by a maintenance of the balance
of power so that no one State should become pre-eminent. His violent
and unscrupulous enemy Sixtus IV. used every arm against him. When
assassination failed he tried excommunication, and the laying of
Florence under an interdict. The Florentines answered by appointing
twelve citizens as a bodyguard to Lorenzo, and bidding the clergy to
celebrate the sacraments. His sagacity, not only as a Tuscan but an
Italian, was shown by the able way in which he traversed French schemes
for interfering in Italy, although the fortune of his house was largely
dependent on the well-being of the bank at Lyons. So quietly and
unostentatiously was this done that French ambassadors were instructed
to act according to his advice, and he became the intermediary between
Rome and Paris.<a id="FNanchor_155" href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> “Lorenzo,” writes Dr. Creighton, “had striven
to identify the Medici family with Florence, and had been himself
the representative and expression of the desires and aspirations of
Florentine life and culture. He had also learned that the existence
of Italy depended upon the maintenance of internal peace, and his
efforts for that end had, for the last ten years of his life, been
unceasing. His early experience had taught him how difficult was the
position<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span> which he had to maintain, that of chief citizen of a free
city, whose fortunes and whose very existence depended on exercising
absolute power without seeming to do so. It is easy to accuse him of
insidiously destroying Florentine liberty; but the policy of Sixtus IV.
left him no choice between such a course and retirement from Florence,
and he may be pardoned if he doubted whether his abdication would
conduce to the welfare of the city. He has been accused of abetting the
moral enervation and corruption of his people; but the causes of this
corruption are to be found in the general character of Italian life,
and Lorenzo did no more than follow the prevailing fashion in lending
his refinement to give expression to the popular taste. Lorenzo did
what all Italian statesmen were doing; he identified his city for good
and ill with his own house. He worked craftily and insidiously, not by
open violence, and in the midst of his self-seeking he retained the
large views of a statesman and embodied the culture of his age.”<a id="FNanchor_156" href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a></p>

<p>The Marquess Gino Capponi in his History of Florence writes: “The
Medici palace was a museum, a school, and a place of meeting for all
the learned men who flocked thither, from it proceeded grave counsel
and intellectual teaching as well as shows and festivals, and a general
corruption of manners. Two popes passed their childhood there, and the
Platonic Academy, intended to raise the standard of life and thought,
was founded within its walls. Poliziano and Pico della Mirandola, one
of the greatest men of his time, were constant visitors. There the
first chips flew off the marble under the chisel of Michelangelo, and
there Luigi Pulci read the Morgante aloud. Such exuberance of life,
such magnificence, such gaiety, has probably never been witnessed in
any other age, and the name of Lorenzo towers above it all.”<a id="FNanchor_157" href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>A brief narrative of the course of my life and of some other important
things worthy of remembrance for the guidance and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span> information of
those who will succeed me, and especially for my sons. Begun this day,
the 15th March 1472.</p>

<p>I find from the books of Piero our father that I was born on January
1, 1449 [1450]. By our mother Maria Lucrezia di Francesco Tornabuoni
our father had seven children, four male and three female, of whom
four are still alive. They are Giuliano my brother, aged ... and
myself, aged twenty-four, Bianca, wife of Gugliemo de’ Pazzi, and
Nannina, wife of Bernardo Rucellai.</p>

<p>Giovanni d’ Averardo, surnamed Bicci, de’ Medici, our
great-grandfather, died on the 20th February 1428, at the fourth hour
of the night. He would not make a will, and left property to the
amount of 179,221 scudi <i>di suggello</i>, as appears in a record in
the handwriting of Cosimo our grandfather in his red leather book on
page 7. The said Giovanni lived sixty-eight years, and left two sons,
Cosimo our grandfather, then about forty, and Lorenzo, aged thirty.</p>

<p>Lorenzo had one son, Pier Francesco, born on ... 1430, who is still
alive.</p>

<p>Cosimo had two sons, our father Piero, born ... and our uncle
Giovanni, born ... On September ... 1433 our grandfather Cosimo
was imprisoned in the Palace, and in danger of losing his head. On
September 9th he was banished to Padua, together with his brother
Lorenzo, a sentence confirmed by the Balìa of 1433 on the 11th, and on
the 16th December he was permitted to reside anywhere in the Venetian
territory, but not nearer to Florence than Padua.</p>

<p>On September 29, 1434, the Council of the Balìa revoked the sentence
of exile, to the great joy of the whole city and of almost all Italy,
and here [in Florence] he lived until his last day as head of the
government of our Republic.</p>

<p>Lorenzo de’ Medici, brother of Cosimo our grandfather, quitted this
life at Careggi on September 20, 1440, aged about forty-six, at the
fourth hour of the night, and would not make a will; Pier Francesco,
his son, was his sole heir. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span> property amounted to 235,137 scudi
<i>di suggello</i>, as appears in the said book kept by Cosimo on page
13, which amount Cosimo kept for the use and benefit of the said Pier
Francesco, and for Piero and Giovanni, his own sons, until they were
of proper age, as appears in the books of the said Cosimo, wherein is
a detailed account of all.</p>

<p>On December ... 1451 the said Pier Francesco being of age, we
divided the property according to the arbitration of Messer Mannello
degl’ Strozzi, Bernardo de’ Medici, Alamanno Salviati, Messer Carlo
Marsuppino, Amerigo Cavalcanti, and Giovanni Serristori, by whom a
liberal half of our possessions was assigned to him, giving him the
advantage over us and the best things. The deed was drawn up by Ser
Antonio Pugi, notary, and at the same time we gave him an interest of
one-third in our business, whereby he gained much more than we did as
he had no expenses.</p>

<p>Giovanni, our uncle (<i>et hujus quidem ingenio et virtute, plurimum
confidebat Cosmus, qua propter ejus interitu maxime doluit</i>), died
on November 1, 1463, in our house in Florence, without making a will,
because he had no children and was under parental tutelage. But all
his last wishes were faithfully carried out. By Maria Ginevra degl’
Alessandri he had a son named Cosimo, who died in November 1461, at
about the age of nine.</p>

<p>Cosimo our grandfather, a man of exceeding wisdom, died at Careggi
on August 1, 1464, being much debilitated by old age and by gout, to
the great grief not only of ourselves and of the whole city but of
all Italy, because he was most famous and adorned with many singular
virtues. He died in the highest position any Florentine citizen ever
attained at any period, and was buried in S. Lorenzo. He refused to
make a will and forbade all pomp at his funeral. Nevertheless all the
Italian princes sent to do him honour and to condole with us on his
death; among others H.M. the King of France commanded that he should
be honoured with his banner,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span> but out of respect for his wishes our
father would not allow it. By public decree he was named <span class="smcap">Pater
Patriæ</span>, and the decree and the letters patent are in our house.
After his death much sedition arose in the city, especially was our
father persecuted out of envy. From this sprang the parliament and the
change of government in 1466, when Messer Agnolo Acciaiuoli, Messer
Diotisalvi, Niccolò Soderini, and others were exiled, and the State
was reformed.</p>

<p>In the year 1465 H.M. King Louis of France, out of regard for the
friendship between our grandfather, our father, and the House of
France, decorated our escutcheon with three Lilies d’or on a field
azure, which we carry at present. We have the patents with the royal
seal attached, which was approved and confirmed in the Palace with
nine beans [votes].</p>

<p>In July 1467 came the Duke Galeazzo of Milan. He was fighting against
Bartolomeo of Bergamo in the Romagna, who was vexing our State. By his
own wish he lodged in our house, although the Signory had prepared
everything for him in S. Maria Novella.</p>

<p>In February or in March of the same year Sarzana, Sarzanelle, and
Castelnuovo were bought by the aid of our father Piero from M.
Lorenzo and M. Tommasino da Campofregoso; notwithstanding that we
were engaged in hot war the payment was made by Francesco Sassetti,
our confidential agent, at that time one of the managers of the
<i>Monte</i>.</p>

<p>I, Lorenzo, took to wife Clarice, daughter of the Lord Jacopo Orsini,
or rather she was given (<i>i.e.</i> betrothed) to me in December
1468, and the marriage was celebrated in our house on June 4, 1469.
Till now I have by her two children, a girl called Lucrezia, of ...
years, and a boy named Piero, of ... months. Clarice is again with
child. God preserve her to us for many years and guard us from all
evil. Twin boys were born prematurely at about five or six months old,
they lived long enough to be baptized.</p>

<p>In July 1469 I went to Milan at the request of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span> Illustrious Duke
Galeazzo to stand godfather as proxy for Piero our father to his
first-born child. I was received with much honour, more so than the
others who came for the same purpose, although they were persons more
worthy than I. We paid our duty to the Duchess by presenting her with
a necklace of gold with a large diamond, which cost near 2000 ducats.
The consequence was that the said Lord desired that I should stand
godfather to all his children.</p>

<p>To do as others had done I held a joust in the Piazza S. Croce at
great expense and with great pomp. I find we spent about 10,000 ducats
<i>di suggello</i>, and although I was not highly versed in the use of
weapons and the delivery of blows, the first prize was given to me; a
helmet fashioned of silver, with Mars as the crest.</p>

<p>Piero, our father, departed this life on July 2nd, aged ... having
been much tormented with gout. He would not make a will, but we drew
up an inventory and found we possessed 237,988 scudi, as is recorded
by me in a large green book bound in kid. He was buried in S. Lorenzo,
and we are still at work to make his and his brother Giovanni’s tomb
as worthy to receive his bones as we can. God have mercy on their
souls. He was much mourned by the whole city, being an upright man and
exceedingly kindly. The princes of Italy, especially the principal
ones, sent letters and envoys to condole with us and offer us their
help for our defence.</p>

<p>The second day after his death, although I, Lorenzo, was very young,
being twenty years of age, the principal men of the city and of the
State came to us in our house to condole with us on our loss and
to encourage me to take charge of the city and of the State, as my
grandfather and my father had done. This I did, though on account of
my youth and the great responsibility and perils arising therefrom,
with great reluctance, solely for the safety of our friends and of our
possessions. <span class="smcap">For it is ill living in Florence for the rich unless
they rule the State.</span> Till now we have succeeded with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span> honour and
renown, which I attribute not to prudence but to the grace of God and
the good conduct of my predecessors.</p>

<p>I find that from 1434 till now we have spent large sums of money, as
appear in a small quarto note-book of the said year to the end of
1471. Incredible are the sums written down. They amount to 663,755
florins for alms, buildings, and taxes, let alone other expenses. But
I do not regret this, for though many would consider it better to
have a part of that sum in their purse, I consider that it gave great
honour to our State, and I think the money was well expended, and am
well pleased.</p>

<p>In the month of September 1471 I was elected to go as ambassador for
the coronation of Pope Sixtus, and was treated with great honour. I
brought back the two antique marble heads, portraits of Augustus and
Agrippa, given to me by the said Pope Sixtus, and also our cup of
chalcedony incised, and many other cameos which I then bought.</p>
</div>

<p>The following adjunct is written on the fly-leaf of a small codex in
the archive in Florence without any date, but probably in 1483-5,
containing a list of letters written by Lorenzo to various people,
and above is written <i>Ricordi di Lorenzo de’ Medici</i>. All the
first part is in a codex in the Nazionale Library, a copy of Lorenzo’s
<i>Ricordi</i>, the original of which seems no longer to exist. It
differs somewhat from the version given by Roscoe, which he says was in
Lorenzo’s own handwriting.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>On the 19th day of September [1483] came the news that the King of
France by his own free will had given to our Giovanni the Abbey of
Fonte Dolce. On the 31st we heard from Rome that the Pope had ratified
this and declared him capable of holding benefices, being seven
years of age, and had created him a Protonotary. On the 1st June our
Giovanni came from Poggio [a Caiano] and I with him. On his arrival
he was confirmed by our Monsignore of Arezzo [Gentile Becchi] who
gave him the tonsure, and thereafter he was called Messer Giovanni.
These ceremonies took place in our own chapel, and in the evening
we returned to Poggio. On the 8th June<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span> Jacopino, the courier from
France, arrived about twelve of the clock with letters from the king,
who has bestowed on our Messer Giovanni the Archbishopric of Aix en
Provence, and after vespers the man was despatched to Rome about this
business, with letters from the King of France to the Pope and the
Cardinal of Macon, and to Count Girolamo, to whom we sent at the same
hour letters by the courier Zenino to Forlì. God grant that all will
be well.</p>

<p>On the 11th Zenino returned from the Count with letters for the Pope
and the Cardinal of S. Giorgio, and we forwarded them to Rome by the
Milan post. God grant that all will be well. On the same day after
Mass in the chapel the daughters and sons of the house were confirmed,
with the exception of Messer Giovanni.</p>

<p>On the 15th, at six in the evening, came letters from Rome saying that
the Pope raised difficulties about giving the archbishopric to Messer
Giovanni on account of his youth, and the courier was at once sent on
to the King of France.</p>

<p>On the 20th came news from Lionetto that the Archbishop was not dead.</p>

<p>On March 1, 1484 (1485), the Abbot of Pasignano died and we at once
sent off an express messenger to Messer Giovanni d’Antonio Vespucci,
our ambassador at Rome, to do all he could to obtain this abbey for
our Messer Giovanni. On the 2nd we took possession of the estate under
the seal of the Signoria, by reason of the reservation made by Pope
Sixtus to our Messer Giovanni, confirmed by Innocent during the visit
of our Piero to Rome to do obeisance.<a id="FNanchor_158" href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a></p>

offer to you all the Iliad. It rests with you, who can, to help the
poet. I desire no other muse or other Gods but only you; by your help
I can do that of which the ancients would not have been ashamed. May
it please you therefore at your leisure to give audience to Homer.

<p>Lorenzo, poet and fine critic, at once sent for the youth, installed
him in his palace in Via Larga and bade him continue his work. This is
the first letter Poliziano wrote to Lorenzo.<a id="FNanchor_161" href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a></p>

<p>The following letter to Contessina, Lorenzo’s grandmother,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span> written
in 1471 when Lorenzo and five other eminent Florentine citizens went
to Rome to pay their respects to the newly elected Pontiff, shows how
men turned to the Medici for aid, and that the women of the family had
more influence than is generally supposed. Sixtus IV. named Lorenzo
treasurer to the Holy See and gave him the two busts mentioned in his
<i>Ricordi</i>. He was also able to buy many fine medals, cameos, &amp;c.,
as the Pope knew nothing and cared less about art, and only thought of
turning the collection made by Paul II. into money. It was probably
during this visit that the nomination of Giuliano de’ Medici to the
cardinalate was broached, and Sixtus and Lorenzo, who were afterwards
implacable foes, parted the best of friends.</p>

<p>The next letter is from the poet Luigi Pulci who was sent to treat
with King Ferrante about establishing a branch of the Medici bank at
Naples, but in order not to arouse the jealousy of the Duke of Milan he
ostensibly went to get fine horses. The King gave him two for Lorenzo,
but turned a deaf ear to the gentle hints about allowing Garetto,
probably a stud groom, to enter Lorenzo’s service. Soon after Pulci’s
return he accompanied Clarice to Rome for the marriage of one of her
brothers, which was however put off.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Magnificent and noble Lady</span>,—It is a usual thing when in
need to address those in whom one has firm faith. Having therefore
heard that the Magnificent Lorenzo has been named ambassador to His
Sanctity our Holy Father, and having two sons of nearly the same age
who are only desirous to do what is pleasing to you, I send one to
you, praying with all my heart that it may please him to take the lad
with him as his page, or attendant, or relation, or in any position
he chooses. And as there is no recommendation like a mother’s I send
him to you, beseeching you in God’s name to arrange that he should,
if possible, take him instead of some stranger. If he be already
provided, then may it please you to give him to your Giuliano or to
whomso else you think fit, so that he may acquire some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span> knowledge by
your help, for he is apt: if he remains here he will learn nothing.
I grieve to give you so much trouble, but I grieve more to see him
anxious to learn and not to be able to help him, save through your
being moved to take compassion on him. I beg you for the love of God
not to abandon him, for he has a good nature and a desire to do well,
and God in His grace will repay you for me. I know you are aware of
my condition and so do not recall it to you; have no regard for his
nobility, if you cannot place him as I said, he will always be well
pleased. I give him to you entirely, and as you would accept a dog as
a gift you can accept a human creature who is more faithful. I entreat

<p><i>Magnifice et generose vir et major honorande</i>, &amp;c.—I know not
if thou hast received my two letters from Naples. By the replies I
doubt it, and therefore repeat some portions. In the last I told
thee that H.M. the King, hearing that thy liking for his Fals’ Amico
and Abruzzese still continued, has decided to send them both.<a id="FNanchor_162" href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a>
I know this because as soon as I returned to Naples the other day
Count Matalona said to Gostino Billiotti, who went to see his garden,
“Our Lord the King has ordered two fine horses to be sent to your
Magnificent Lorenzo, and says if he wishes for others he is to say
so, for finding that he takes pleasure in them, the King intends to
keep him supplied, and that nothing would give him greater pleasure
than to be asked for others, or for anything else.” We thanked him,
and also sent thanks to H.M. the King, adding that the sooner they
were sent the more welcome they would be. Yesterday<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span> we saw the Count
again, and he told us that Messer Antonio Cicinello was to take the
horses: he is to leave in two days, and to go to thee as ambassador.
So the horses will be there in twelve days, and as I think thou wilt
like them I am well pleased. In Rome I heard from Garetto that thy
wish is to take him into thy service, so we have dropped gentle hints
of this to H.M. the King, and now let them work. Messer Marino has
done this skilfully, but the drum must not be beaten too hard, for he
has been more glad to give thee these horses than thou art to have
them. During these last days he talked of thee for several hours with
Garetto in the presence of the Count and asked much about Giuliano,
what he was like and what were his favourite pursuits. He showed such
a desire to see him that one of these days thou wilt have to grant him
permission to come here, where he will be received with such pleasure,
and with so much honour, that all at home will be astonished: I am not
exaggerating. Thou canst believe me as thou knowest, and when I return
I will tell thee things that will please thee.</p>

<p>Hadst thou done as I said, and written a line, thou wouldest have
had Garetto. Certes thou hast not done this, but we will do what we
can; he never tires praising thee, and wishes to live and die in thy
service.</p>

<p>A large army is being collected here against the Turks, but the King’s
ambassador writes that he has small hope of any help from thee. I
trust God may convert thee during Lent, and cause thee to behave as a
Christian. I shall soon be with thee. My poor Bernardo has I know need
of thine aid at the <i>Monte</i> about his dower, which cost us 5 per
cent. with the sister-in-law who appeared to be our friend, Luca’s
dower.<a id="FNanchor_163" href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> Bernardo is timid by nature, and not enterprising like me;
so I pray thee to give him the help he asks if thou canst.</p>

<p>All thy doings are much discussed here, with us thou art in good
hands, and above all thou art the darling of our Lord<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span> the King. May
God preserve thee. I commend myself to thee.—Naples, February 27,
1471 (1472).</p>

<p>To Giuliano and to all I commend myself and send greetings. Written in
haste.</p>

<p>Put Dionigi on Abruzzese, so that he may, like Francesco de’ Pazzi,
regain his lady’s love; but do not keep him shut up as on the day of
S. John.</p>

<p><i>Post Scriptum.</i>—The Duke has told Gostino that the horses are
to leave to-morrow with one of his own men, who will not be Garetto;
but early in the morning I will try whether by means of Count Matalona
it cannot be arranged. A handsome and good horse, much admired
here, is also being sent for our Gugliemo de’ Pazzi, who will be
pleased.<a id="FNanchor_164" href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> Commend me to him.</p>

women of his family and some of his sisters-in-law. Then by his and
Filippo’s advice, after a rest at Levane, on the second evening we
arrived at Arezzo, and Morello—that is, Antonio da Pantaneto—greeted
us with such honour that we were much moved. We were visited by the
Captain and the Podestà and those of the Commune with such things as
they deemed would do us honour, and at our arrival and departure we
were accompanied by many men of worth with diverse instruments. Before
starting, the Podestà of Castiglione sent a special messenger, and
begged and entreated us to dine the following morning with him, which
we did with the more pleasure as we heard he was much attached<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span> to
your Magnificence. Then we were visited by those of the Commune, and
this evening we shall be in Cortona with the Captain, who hearing from

have done till now, if by your letter we hear that you have commended
us to Mona Contessina and Mona Lucrezia, and that my Lucrezia and
Piero are well. Commend me to Bianca and Nannina. If you have any news

went for some days to Monte Rotondo,<a id="FNanchor_167" href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> and were received with much
honour. Yesterday we entered Rome in pomp with about eighty horse.
Our Madonna Clarice does thee great honour everywhere, and much is
paid to her. In two days I shall return to the Marches, and then to
thee. According to my idea the stay here will be short—I mean thy
wife’s—for as thou knowest the wedding is put off. In this case we
only lose time and reputation, besides which Lucrezina and Pierino
draw us back to them like magnets. Thou wouldst do well to advise
a quick return. Whenever great personages, men or women, stay for
long in one place they are pestered and taken as targets. Besides,
some of us will be useful to thee for the feast of S. Giovanni;
more than a year has passed since the last, and I know that without
us things will lag. Enough that if I have the hope that as usual
<i>festaiuoli</i><a id="FNanchor_168" href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> are to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span> appointed, I shall whisper something
into the ear of one of them that will delight him. I rather wonder at
thy letting this feast pass with so little recognition, being so good
a citizen and lover of thy country, whose protector is S. Giovanni; we
should therefore do him honour. If by any mischance we are not back in
time, thou wilt see how ill they get on without us. I have said enough
to be understood, believe in one who has sharp eyes and can speak the
truth. Send for us. We take the road by Siena, and shall look out for
falls, but at last we shall arrive triumphantly.</p>

<p>To-day there is strange news from Volterra. They say H.M. the King
[of Naples] has sent word to the Count of Urbino that he is to march
and do what he can. All the follies I said unfortunately turn out to
be prophecies. Now act so that things may go well. Monsignor of Pavia
speaks only of thee. If I understand anything he is thy true friend.
No more. Farewell.—Rome, May 6, 1472.</p>

<p><i>Sanctissime et Beatissime Pater</i>,—To avoid troubling your
Beatitude I have written to Giovanni Tornabuoni and told him to
talk with you about the long-standing desire of our house to have
a Cardinal. Although I have such entire faith in Your Sanctity
that I am sure it is needless again to solicit what was so freely
promised, nevertheless as there is a report that Cardinals are soon
to be created I thought it best to remind your Beatitude of this our
desire; supplicating with all humility that to our other everlasting
obligations your Beatitude will deign to add this one, which will be
the greatest and the most prized, as Giovanni will explain. I beg Your
Beatitude to accord him the same confidence as though I was speaking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>

<p>The following letter was written after Lorenzo’s visit to Volterra.
The city had rebelled against Florence in consequence of a dispute
between a company in which Florentine shareholders were interested,
and the Commune of Volterra about an alum mine. The Commune alleged
that the lease was illegal and seized the mine, whereupon the company
appealed to the Signoria of Florence. Volterra had already, in 1429,
attempted to rise against the imposition of the <i>catasto</i>, and the
Florentines now determined to take severe measures.<a id="FNanchor_172" href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a> Duke Federigo
of Urbino, the Florentine general, in command of some six thousand men,
including contingents from the Pope and the Duke of Milan, attacked the
city. Her mercenaries refused to fight, and she capitulated after a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>
siege of twenty-five days. When the troops entered there was an uproar,
caused it is said by a mercenary in the service of the city, which was
sacked and the inhabitants were brutally maltreated in spite of the
efforts of the Florentine commanders.<a id="FNanchor_173" href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> Many historians have accused
Lorenzo of being the prime instigator of the attack on Volterra in
order to get control of the alum mine. But his name is not in the list
of shareholders and the deposit of alum was too small to compete with
the mines of Tolfa of which he was the lessee (see pp. <a href="#Page_98">98-99</a>), and was
soon afterwards abandoned.</p>

<p><i>Magnifice vir et protector mi singularis commendatione
premissa</i>, &amp;c.,—I derived great consolation from the visit of Your
Magnificence to Volterra. With your own eyes you should see and judge
far better than by listening to the accounts of others of the public
and private despair and misery here. You have seen the afflicted and
faithful friends and servants of Your Magnificence naked, despoiled
of all their goods, robbed without mercy, for everything was taken
during the sack of the city; and I doubt not that Your Magnificence
with your kindly nature was moved to great compassion. Your arrival
and seeing with your own eyes has been the sole hope of this people
and has consoled and comforted them greatly. Therefore by this present
and by other letters I have written to Your Magnificence (I know
not whether you received them), I beg and pray of you not to allow
them to be deprived of that hope, and to show them your justice and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>
grace by helping and restoring, and listening to the prayers of this
wretched and miserable city. Now that she belongs faithfully and
devotedly to Your Magnificence and to the Florentine State she ceases
to be an enemy. All now depends on Your Magnificence. We do not so
much expect as feel certain that we shall receive this help from you;
first from your own goodness, and then for love of the blessed memory
of the grandfather and father of Your Magnificence, to whom this
poor and miserable city, which always formed part and parcel of the
house of Your Magnificence, showed such reverence. Especially we your
partisans, for our affection and devotion, have been so ill-treated
and smitten that we are reduced to nothing, unless Your Magnificence,
who has never known what it is to be ungrateful or unjust, does not
let us share in your victory as belonging entirely to you, and taking
pity on our unhappy and miserable condition will care for and guard
us, who desire only to live and die under the protection of Your
Magnificence, whom God preserve in happiness.—Volterra, March 10,

<p><i>Magnifice et Clarissime Vir</i>,—The Magnificent Messer Ciccho,
my compeer, has advised me that I should be better and more quickly
employed in the service of friends of this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span> Illustrious Lord [Duke of
Milan] than in Rome or any other place, and has mentioned the chair
which Your Illustrious Republic has instituted anew at Pisa. Advice
was indeed unnecessary, for I desire nothing better than to be in a
place where I can use my abilities in the service of that renowned
Signoria, and more particularly in yours, to whom I am so indebted.
But considering your laws against rebels, among whom, thanks to Carlo
d’Arezzo and Poggio with their crew, I was most unjustly included, I
have delayed making any application as I thought it would be useless.
Now however that my beloved compeer has again mentioned it, and
remembering the Greek proverb that the potter fixes the handle on
whichever side of the pot seems best to him, I have determined to
write to you and to beg Your Magnificence to consider this, for you
well know that in this land you cannot find another Philelphus or a
man more devoted to yourself.</p>

<p>Then about my coats which are together with the books which you have
recovered for me. They are three, two of crimson velvet, the other a
cloak of rose-coloured cloth lined with rose-coloured silk. You would
do me a great service if you would order the cloak to be given back to
me as I need it now the weather is warmer, also it might be spoiled
by cockroaches, as it is together with those that are lined with fur.

<p><span class="smcap">Lorenzo mine</span>,—Your Donato having provided me with spectacles
to see far and near, I now write to try whether they are good. And
you will have patience if it is not clear, for nature’s laws are
inexorable. I will be as brief as possible. It will not be long before
the Holy Father will be obliged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span> to make new Cardinals, particularly
for those States which have none. You, for instance, are without,
which for many reasons is unseemly. There has been much talk here of
your Giuliano, and by fishing at the fountain-head I find he has been
mentioned in the proper quarter. I know not what are your intentions,
and do not pretend to give advice as I am sure you know the needs of
your house better than I. All I say is that you must make up your
mind. If you do think of Giuliano I doubt he may be too unpolished
at present to please here; it would be better for him to assume the
surplice of the Church or of a Protonotary, then I think there would
be no difficulty. If, to avoid any accidents and to preserve your
house or for any other reason, this plan does not please you (and the
suggestion should come from others and not from yourself), you had
better reflect whether the Archbishop of Pisa<a id="FNanchor_177" href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> or any one else
would suit you, and take measures, for to remain inert is unwise,
particularly as you consider that a Cardinal would be useful to the
city and to yourself. Choose any one, so he is not a person to be
ashamed of. On my part whatever aid a poor priest can give is yours as
is my bounden duty. For this I have written you these few words, which
accept as from a good friend and a lover of you and of your country,
to which I owe much. <i>Bene Valete.</i>—<i>Romæ</i>, April 25,

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Lorenzo mine</span>,—This is the result of a long conversation with
Giovanni [Tornabuoni]. I am not in the position to advise you whether
it would be well to continue this affair of your Giuliano, because
it depends on the state of things in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span> Florence, with which I am not
familiar. You know them better than I. Only I wished for information
<i>in utramque partem</i>, whether yes or no. To begin with, any
possible danger to yourself or to your house is a matter that must be
considered, for many eyes are upon you both at home and abroad; a man
sees and hopes to be able to give one blow, who has no hope of giving
two, and thinks that striking one adversary will serve his purpose;
but the other would remain, and thus his design would fail. Braccio of
Perugia did not attack his enemy, Messer Pandolfo, until after many
months he saw father and son together in one place; then having both,
he cut the tree and its roots with one stroke. Besides this danger
there is the other of sickness, which occurs every day. Should it
please God to call you to Himself, and Giuliano were in the position
we are striving for while your children were still young, it seems
to me your house would be in danger to lose the pre-eminence left by
Cosimo to Piero, and by Piero to you, and with the pre-eminence lose
the riches, and thus close the door against your successors. On the
other hand, there is the reputation which would be acquired by the
enhanced dignity of Giuliano, the aid he might give to your State, and
the certainty of having a trusty person in the College. Then one hopes
that, as danger increases, your watchfulness would also increase, that
God in His mercy will preserve you, and that you may live long enough
to see your children be a support to you, and finally that they will
inherit your high position. But, as I said before, you must judge
according to matters domestic and public in Florence what is best to
be done. Speaking for myself, nothing would be more pleasing than to
have the company of Giuliano, and we having such a pledge should be
entitled to expect faithful aid from your State. His joyous nature
would make us all jocund and happy.</p>

<p>Let us therefore assume that you say Yes. I will tell you frankly my
opinion how the business ought to be managed. I consider it necessary
that he should be made a Protonotary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span> and be seen in that dress
for at least a month; for none of us would venture to suggest that
from a layman he should at once be promoted to so high a position.
But I should not let him take any holy orders until what he desires
has been accomplished, so that if difficulties arise he may be at
liberty to return to his usual dress, a thing I have seen done quite
justifiably by others. His position would not be that of a full
Cardinal; <i>videlicet</i> he would only have four or six chaplains
in his train, and eight equerries to precede him. Because, although
we are sure to do much more for him, here humility is much prized.
<i>In reliquis</i>, between Messer Gentile [Bishop of Arezzo] and
myself, for I shall regard him as my son, he shall be so advised as
to gain universal commendation. I see no difficulty, if his Holiness
lives, to his attaining the highest honour, for I can promise for
more than one [vote]. Have no uneasiness about the cardinals who have
just been made, as it will be necessary soon to create others for
the Emperor and King Ferdinand, for Rome and for you Florentines,
if you desire it; it had been arranged to await Pentecost for their
nominations, but certain reasons, as you will have heard, induced
greater haste. In short, Lorenzo, examine well my advice and that of
others who are better informed, which I think you will have received:
<i>et tandem</i> put your trust in God as to what path to pursue.
Take a courageous course, and tell me what you wish done. It would,
however, be well beforehand to inform the Duke of Milan, <i>et quidem
pro forma</i>, in order that he should not say No to what you desire;
if you are in doubt ask for his real opinion. For my own satisfaction
I have not contented myself with writing to Giovanni [Tornabuoni],
but have scrawled these lines. I am fond of you, and I love you, not
your position or your riches. Charity bids me say everything openly,
and attribute everything to her. <i>Dominus Deus sit in corde vestro,
et dirigat gressus vestros in semitam rectam.</i> That He should do
this increase your donations to pious works and cause special prayers
to be made, for in truth the affair is not a light one,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span> or of small
importance, and all in my judgment depends on His clemency. <i>Bene

Magnificence is aware how attached and bound to your house our

encourages us to turn to you in our necessities and troubles, and also
in those of any of our friends who have need to have recourse to Your
Magnificence who has always been kind to us and helped us. We hope
now more than ever in you on account of the great faith we all have
in your house; for could you but know you would find the name of your
family written in the hearts of big and little of our community. Now
Magnificent Madonna, after such long and tedious words, we come to
implore aid from Your Magnificence. It is several months since one
Ser Michele, a priest, was seized by the Lords of Vazoca, they say
for coining money, and after suffering much torture he was put in the
Stinche,<a id="FNanchor_180" href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> thus it may be conceived that he has been sufficiently
punished for his sins. Here live some relations of his, honourable
men, who are desirous for the honour of the world to liberate him from
such misery, and we, agreeing with him, come to beg Your Magnificence
to ask them [the Lords of Vazoca] to allow him to be released from
this wretchedness so that he should not die in such infamy. Your
Magnificence would be doing a most kind act to this community<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span> for
which we shall be ever grateful. We commend him strongly to you, and
also we commend ourselves, offering to Your Magnificence your ever

Nevertheless the more good one hears of one’s family the more
contented and happy one is; let us thank God heartily with words and
acts, as S. Paul says to the Ephesians in the epistle we shall read on
Sunday morning.</p>

<p>To begin with, Mona Contessina is well. Giuliano is as usual. I have
often been to see Mona Bianca<a id="FNanchor_182" href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> who is well, and her children
have been for three days with Mona Contessina to her great delight.
Lucrezia still has a little eczema, otherwise she is well, and is well
cared for by Mona Nanna and she ...<a id="FNanchor_183" href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a>; little Lucrezia is obedient,
like the wise little person she is. Piero has a fine colour and is
happy and full of spirits, by the grace of God; he often comes to the
side door calling you all, saying Granny, Papa, and Mamma, so that
you would laugh if you were here. Maddalena is also well and every
day when I return from the house of the Tornabuoni I go to stay a
little with her, and to the wet nurse I say, “Now go, walk a little;”
so that she may amuse herself and take some exercise, and thus keep
in good health and have better milk. She is very pleased, and thanks
me saying, “I shall pray to God for you.” Of a truth she serves you
faithfully and well. Mona Nannina’s<a id="FNanchor_184" href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> Cosimino is well but will
not read, saying, “I did<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span> not come into the country to read.” This
displeases Mona Contessina. In November we will make up for lost time.
Galasso<a id="FNanchor_185" href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> comes to read with me every morning, and then I go,
for love of the children, back with him. He gives me much trouble,
although it does not seem great to me, because I do it willingly for
the love of God, and for love of Lorenzo, Mona Clarice, and you,
for you know I am yours. I have even for the honour of God made him
learn by heart little by little the Salve Regina, and part of the
introit and of the psalter. Sister Magante has gone to another world,
<i>requiescat in pace</i>. I know that you must have many petitioners,
but when any little thing like this of small value falls in, think
of me, you know my need, and that you would have a faithful servant.
All your relations are well. Mona Bartolomea and Mona Francesca often
go to see Mona Contessina and the children. The men are well also.
All commend themselves to you. I commend myself to you, to Lorenzo,
to Mona Clarice, and to Mona Nannina. No more. Christ guard you from
ill.—September 25, 1473.</p>

and worth twelve or fifteen florins a month, and there are no duties.

by my affection, my need, and the straits in which I find myself. I

the clay to the potter, because hideous pots had been made for me,
and because I perceive that the peppered dishes of our knight of
Prato, Messer Luca Calvanese, are more esteemed by Count Girolamo
than all other talents, sciences, or arts, they having obtained for
him knighthood. Now the art of cooking is not inborn in Luca, but has
been obtained by him in a piggish way solely out of my book, and I
believe the cleanest dish he ever prepared was at Monte Guffoni, when
he gave you two plates full of beccafichi<a id="FNanchor_191" href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a> cooked by hand. So I
have determined to abandon all other arts and to take to cooking, and
therefore pray Your Magnificence to recommend me to the head steward,

two giacomini<a id="FNanchor_193" href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> or two jellies, the Count would have created me
Prior of Pisa. And I say if they make him head<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span> of the giants, or of
something else which had better not be mentioned, you are the better
judge, I being a pupil of Donato. But above all, before Messer Luca
has taken possession of it, I beg you to get me back my cookery book.
Once I have it in my hands trust me to put him, his pepper-pot, his
wantons and his title, into a pie covered with pepper, without passing
them through a sieve, and then I will make so many pills of it. May

<p>In 1475 everything was peaceful in Italy. Lorenzo was able to give his
attention to the reconstruction of the University of Pisa, in which
town he spent some months, to devote himself to poetry and philosophy,
and often to indulge in his love of outdoor sports. Niccolò Roberti,
Duke Borso d’Este’s ambassador to Florence, wrote to his master in
January:</p>


<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Most illustrious Lord</span>,—There is no news to send save that
near Pisa, where Lorenzo is enjoying much sport with the King’s
[Ferrante of Naples] hawkers, two of the falcons sent to him by H.M.
have been lost, and they are the two best. Your Excellency must not
wonder at my sending such news, because here little else is talked
about. Idleness is so universal in Italy that if things do not change
there will be more to write of battles between birds and dogs than of
armies and gallant deeds.—January 22, 1474 (1475).</p>
</div>

<p>In this same year was held Giuliano de’ Medici’s magnificent and
costly tournament, which would however be forgotten<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span> had not Poliziano
written his immortal <i>Stanze per la Giostra del Magnifico Giuliano
di Piero de’ Medici</i>, “a masterpiece,” writes Symonds, “which
blent the ancient and the modern world in a work of art glowing with
Italian fancy.... Each stanza of <i>La Giostra</i> is a mimic world
of beauty, art, and scholarship; a painting where the object stands
before us modelled with relief of light and shade in finely modulated
lines....”<a id="FNanchor_195" href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a></p>

<p><i>Magnifica Domina mea</i>,—I did not write yesterday to Your
Magnificence because Lorenzo sent me to Lucca. I have just come back
and take up my pen to keep faith with you. Lorenzo is well and in good
spirits. Yesterday as there was but little wind he went hawking; but
they had not much luck because the young falcon belonging to Pilato,
called the Mantuan, was lost. This morning they went out again, but
the wind was not favourable, nevertheless we saw some fine flights,
and Maestro Giorgio flew his Peregrine falcon which came back to
the lure most obediently.<a id="FNanchor_196" href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> Lorenzo is quite in love with it. Of
a truth he is not wrong, for Maestro Giorgio says he never saw a
handsomer or a better, and declares he will make of him the finest
falcon in the world. While we were in the fields Pilato came back from
the river with his lost falcon, so Lorenzo was doubly pleased. If I
knew what to write I should be glad: but I can only give you news
of his hawking as we do nought else in the fore- and the afternoon.
This evening I hear that on Monday Lorenzo intends to hunt roe deer
and then to return at once to Florence. Please God we may find you
well and with a boy in your arms.<a id="FNanchor_197" href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> I commend myself to Your

<p>By the grace of God we have arrived safely and well at Bagno a Morba,
I trust He will keep you the same. Of the riding horses we have kept
here the ambling palfrey and the chestnut as best suited to this

desired: none of the others stood the journey well, and it seemed
best to me to keep these so that should anything happen we should
not be forced to go afoot. But if you want him, tell me, and send us

<p>There is again talk about the affairs at Milan and the Lord Ruberto
[Count of San Severino]. You will have heard how he went to Milan with
Messer Obietto, and it appears the Illustrious Madonna Duchess heard
of some understanding between them. Donato del Conte, who was also in
the secret, was sent for and imprisoned. Upon which it seems the Lord
Ruberto took arms with his followers and attempted to raise the city
together with some of the Duke’s brothers. Then seeing there was no
hope he fled, and with him went Messer Obietto, who they say to-day
has been taken; of the Lord Ruberto there is as yet no news. The
Duke’s brothers have implored the Duchess to forgive them, alleging
as an excuse that they feared for their lives. The Lord Ottaviano is
reported to have been drowned while flying from his pursuers. There
is also the affair of Messer Antonio <a id="ridolfo"></a>Ridolfo, who was attacked by
some soldiers of Pietra Santa and Melia on his way from the Riviera
of Genoa. After a skirmish of several miles his mounted crossbow-men
showed good fight and wounded and killed those soldiers with great
honour to themselves, and Messer Antonio arrived here safe and sound.</p>

<p><i>Salvus sis, mi suavissime filii</i>,—To-day I have received a
letter in thy name which has caused me much rejoicing, particularly
as thou sayest thou art well and also the others. I am delighted to
hear of the marriage arranged between Cosimino Rucellai<a id="FNanchor_206" href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a> and the
daughter of the Marquess Gabbrielle. Quite an unexpected piece of
news. Coming from so good a source it must be good; and having been
settled by so excellent a person, excellent. We are celebrating it
with great rejoicings, and so are all the people of the Bagni. To
so fortunate and good a beginning may God grant a joyous and happy
ending, <i>et suffit</i>. By the grace of God I am well and have
nearly finished my baths. I have decided, if it pleases God, to leave
this on the 21st, that is Saturday week, and to stay the night with
Madonna Tita, widow of Messer Antonio Cortesi, at San Gemignano. She
has been with me here for several days and entreated me to do this;
then she sent her son, who left this morning, to settle about the
visit. So because of her entreaties, and because she is a widow, I
have been forced to promise without awaiting thy assent. We shall go
quietly and stay little, and on Monday the eve of S. John [23rd June]
we shall be at home. I do not see my way to come before, as I am still
weak from the effects of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span> baths. But should any necessity arise
for me to come sooner, let me know and I will leave all. Send the
horses, if it suits thee, to arrive here on the 19th, so that they
can rest on the 20th, and as I have said, we start early on the 21st.
Seven horses must be sent, nought else is wanted. May Christ keep you
all. I commend myself to thee.—In haste on the 8th day of June 1477.</p>

of whoever was charged to send them. It does not matter, although
there is a dearth of stabling, straw, and oats, but we have sent them
where they will be well cared for and fed until we leave as I said on
the 21st. I cannot leave before as I am very weak and have not yet
finished my baths. But to keep my word and be with thee on S. John’s
day I shall leave, although if I remained another eight days it would
be more necessary than superfluous. However now it is settled. We
shall not be at Florence before Monday for the reasons already given.
So that if thou hast sent the horses before the time fixed in order
that I might be home earlier, forgive me: if I had received a letter
from thee urging me to return I should have left at once without
considering my own convenience and well-being. Nought else. I commend
myself to thee and pray God to keep thee well and happy. Salute the
family and tell them I shall be at home on the vigil of S. John, if it
pleases God, for I never expected to live so long. In haste, in haste,

<p><span class="smcap">Most honoured as a Mother</span>,—As I shall leave at the end of my
service here and am expecting my successor from day to day, I have not
written about the baths. I went there last Friday and found the water
had increased rather than diminished,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span> and that it was extremely hot.
The trench is finished from where the water rises under the building
as far as the baths which have been rebuilt, and are twelve in number.
The cistern is also finished, except covering in the roof, according
to the designs sent; and as far as my poor judgment goes all seems to
me well done, saving that the water will enter the cistern at only
one place and then will have to flow 12-3/4 yards, so that I fear
the baths will be too hot to be borne where the water enters and not
hot enough at the other end. I think the water ought to be brought
into the cistern by two conduits. This might still be easily arranged
by dividing the channel in two when it reaches the room where the
shower baths are, and digging another trench 19 yards long 2-3/4 yards
further in. This can always be done if necessary. There has been some
difficulty in the work, as just under the hill where the water comes
out they have been obliged to underpin the ground and then to cut
through the rock from whence the water comes. But the rock is hard and
3 yards 30 inches thick, and a channel 2 feet long has to be cut in
order that the water may have sufficient fall to flow under the small
palace to the baths. In two or three days I think it will be finished.
The lime has been burnt and they say it is good, about eighty bushels
for twenty soldi; and in the fields opposite the trench they have
found earth fit for making tiles and bricks. The levellers are at work
making them and a Lombard has undertaken to bake them, so they will
cost four lire or less the thousand. They are now in the kiln and this
will be a great saving to you. The room for the shower baths, 4-1/2
yards wide and 12-3/4 yards long, is partly finished, and the bath
at the side also. They say they need certain slabs which are made on
purpose for shower baths, and they want them at once. Riccio has been
dismissed from the inn and Giovanni di Pace has taken it and says that
he has orders for rooms from Volterra, Florence, and elsewhere, and
that in addition to what he has he needs all the things noted in the
enclosed list. The orchard has been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span> planted in a way that will please
you when you see it. I say no more but commend myself to you and may
God preserve you in happiness. Ex Castro di Pomarancii, March 25, <a id="1478"></a>1478.</p>

<p>The following letters from Louis XI., from Lorenzo, and from Sixtus
IV., relate to the famous Pazzi conspiracy when Giuliano de’ Medici was
murdered and Lorenzo wounded in the cathedral of Florence. Antagonism
and rivalry had for some time existed between the two great families,
although Lorenzo’s favourite sister Bianca was married to Gugliemo de’
Pazzi, who had been regarded by Piero almost as his own son, and is
often mentioned in these letters as the companion of the Magnificent
on hunting excursions and visits to foreign courts. Gugliemo’s brother
Francesco, head of the Pazzi bank at Rome, worked incessantly against
Lorenzo’s uncle Giovanni Tornabuoni, manager of the Roman branch of the
Medici bank, and eventually succeeded in depriving him of the business
of the Holy See given to Lorenzo in the first days of Sixtus’ rule. The
third brother, Giovanni de’ Pazzi, was married to Beatrice Borromeo,
who on the death of her father without having made a will claimed,
according to the existing laws, the whole of his property. His nephews,
however, intimate friends of the two young Medici, contested her right,
and in 1476 a retrospective law of intestacy was passed setting aside
the claims of females to the estate of a father who died intestate,
and giving it to the nearest male relative. Machiavelli, Nardi, and
Guicciardini, all accuse Lorenzo of instigating the drafting of “this
law made for the occasion,” as Nardi calls it. Roscoe maintains that it
was passed more than ten years before, but the proofs he adduces are
quite illusory. Without extraneous aid it is however very improbable
that the Pazzi would have dared to attempt the assassination of the two
brothers Medici. This aid they obtained from the Pope. Sixtus IV. had,
as Dr. Creighton says, “elevated nepotism into political principle ...
he took his nephews, men of no position and little capacity, and placed
at their disposal all the resources of the Roman See.” Giuliano della
Rovere and Piero Riario were created cardinals in total disregard of
the regulations of the Conclave,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span> while for Piero’s brother, Girolamo,
he bought Imola from the Duke of Milan, at the same time arranging
a marriage between him and Caterina Sforza, the Duke’s illegitimate
daughter. Florence had long coveted Imola, and Lorenzo tried to prevent
the purchase by raising difficulties about advancing the necessary
money to the Pope. Francesco de’ Pazzi then seized his opportunity and
was appointed Treasurer to the Holy See in Lorenzo’s place.</p>

<p>Another grievance Sixtus had against Florence was the indirect aid
given to Niccolò Vitelli, who had taken the side of Todi and Spoleto
when they rose against the Pope, by despatching troops to Borgo San
Sepolcro when the Cardinal Giuliano della Rovere laid siege to Città
di Castello. The appointment of the anti-Medicean Francesco Salviati,
as Archbishop of Pisa in the place of the late Filippo de’ Medici,
in spite of a previous promise that no archbishop or bishop should
be appointed within Florentine territory save by the consent of the
Signory of Florence, was deeply resented by Lorenzo. Though unable
to prevent the nomination he succeeded in keeping Salviati out of
his archbishopric and consequently without his emoluments for three
years. In 1477 the Pope’s anger against Lorenzo rose to fever-heat.
He suspected, unjustly as it appears, that Florence had aided Carlo
Fortebraccio in his endeavour to seize Perugia. The attempt failed and
Fortebraccio overran the territory of Siena, which at once appealed to
the Pope and the King of Naples, at the same time arrogantly summoning
Florence to immediately recall the condottiere. Fortebraccio was in
Venetian service, so the Florentines answered that they had nothing to
do with him and only wished he would keep quiet.</p>

<p>The murder of Galeazzo Sforza, Duke of Milan, had further complicated
matters. Girolamo Riario was astute enough to realise that if the
Pope died, the change of government in Milan might expose him to the
resentment of Florence, and determined to try and overthrow the Medici.
Francesco de’ Pazzi and Archbishop Salviati were easily persuaded to
join, but shrewd old Jacopo de’ Pazzi, who lived in Florence and knew
the hold the Medici had over the people, gave them no encouragement.
Promises of foreign aid and the assurance of the assent of the Pope
however at last won him over. An Abruzzese, Giovan Battista da
Montesecco, a captain in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span> service of Girolamo Riario, was selected
as a man to be trusted; his confession<a id="FNanchor_212" href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a> is curious reading but
too long to give <i>in extenso</i>. When he met Francesco de’ Pazzi
in the Archbishop Salviati’s house at Rome he expressed grave doubts.
“Have a care, gentlemen, what you are undertaking. Florence is no
small matter, and Lorenzo, I hear, is very popular.” The Archbishop
answered that they knew better how it stood with Lorenzo, that it was
their affair and he was only the instrument. Montesecco then asked what
the Pope would say, and was assured he hated Lorenzo and would follow
their advice. Moreover he would receive the captain. Plans were then
discussed. It was arranged that troops were to be held in readiness
by Giovanni Francesco da Tolentino from Imola, Lorenzo Giustini from
Città di Castello, and Napoleone Orsini from Todi and Perugia, to enter
Florence as soon as the assassins had done their work. Soon afterwards
Montesecco was summoned to the Vatican. “I will have no bloodshed,”
said the Pope, “it is not consistent with my office to cause the death
of any man. Lorenzo has behaved shamefully and iniquitously towards
us, but I do not desire his death, though I do desire a change of
government.” Girolamo Riario promised that everything should be done to
prevent bloodshed, but asked the Pope to pardon any man who was forced
to commit murder. “Thou art a stupid fool,” answered the Pope. “I tell
thee I will have no man killed, but I desire the government to be
changed. To you, Giovan Battista, I repeat that I wish the government
of Florence to be changed and Lorenzo to be overthrown, for he is an
undutiful and a bad man who defies us. When he is out of the way we
can deal as we choose with the Republic which will be most convenient
to us.” Riario and the Archbishop agreed to this and added, “Then Your
Holiness is content that we should take every means to bring this
about?” Sixtus repeated, “Again I say I am not. Go and do what you
will, as long as no blood is shed.” As they left Salviati turned to the
Pope, “Holy Father, are you content that we steer this boat. We will
guide it well.” The Pope answered, “I am. But see to it that the honour
of the Holy See and of the Count does not suffer.”</p>

<p>The Archbishop now went to Pisa, and Francesco de’ Pazzi to Florence.
Knowing the hospitable nature of Lorenzo, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span> suggested that Raffaello
Sansoni, a nephew of Girolamo Riario (whose name he adopted), who had
just been created Cardinal of S. Giorgio at the age of seventeen and
was studying at Pisa, should come to the Pazzi villa near Florence.
As he expected, the lad was at once invited to supper at the Medicean
villa at Fiesole, and the conspirators were jubilant. But Giuliano
was ill and did not come, so they were foiled. The young Cardinal,
simply an instrument in the hands of the Pazzi and the Archbishop,
then expressed a desire to see the Medici palace in town, and proposed
the Sunday before Ascension day (26th April), when he was to celebrate
High Mass in the cathedral. Lorenzo asked him to dine afterwards, and
it was arranged that the two Medici brothers were to be killed as they
rose from table. It is singular that no rumour of the plot had got
abroad, as so many were cognisant of it. Besides Jacopo and Francesco
de’ Pazzi, the Archbishop and Montesecco, there was Jacopo Salviati,
the Archbishop’s brother, and his cousin another Jacopo, Bernardo
Bandini, a dissipated adventurer, and Jacopo Bracciolini, son of Poggio
Bracciolini the humanist, who owed much to the Medici. Jacopo was
deeply in debt and inordinately vain. Two priests, destined to play a
prominent part, were also implicated, Antonio Maffei of Volterra, an
Apostolic scribe, and Stefano da Bagnone, chaplain to Jacopo de’ Pazzi.
Montesecco had hired a band of Perugian exiles, and the Archbishop had
a large retinue; these were to aid in seizing the Palazzo de’ Signori.
At the last moment Giuliano sent word that he was not well enough to
dine, but would attend Mass. The conspirators then determined that
the deed must be done in the cathedral, as on that evening Tolentino
and Giustini would be drawing near to Florence with their troops.
Francesco de’ Pazzi and Bernardo Bandini undertook to kill Giuliano,
Lorenzo was entrusted to the abler hands of Montesecco. No doubt
all would have gone as they had planned but for the scruples of the
soldier, who absolutely refused to commit a murder “where God would see
him.” The two priests, who had no such feeling, offered themselves as
substitutes—and failed.</p>

<p>Lorenzo accompanied the Cardinal and the Archbishop, who had come to
Florence on the pretext of seeing his invalid mother, to the cathedral.
Suddenly the conspirators saw that Giuliano had not come. Francesco de’
Pazzi and Bernardo<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span> Bandini ran across the square and persuaded him
to go with them, affectionately clasping their arms round him to feel
whether he wore a shirt of mail.</p>

<p>The scene in the cathedral is best described in the words of Filippo
Strozzi, who was present: “At the words <i>missa est</i> Ser Stefano da
Bagnone, secretary of Messer Jacopo de’ Pazzi and Messer Antonio Maffei
of Volterra assailed Lorenzo de’ Medici, while Francesco de’ Pazzi
and Bernardo Bandini fell upon Giuliano. Both were walking round the
choir outside, and Lorenzo at once understood, drew his sword, leaped
into the choir, rushed across in front of the altar, entered the new
sacristy and ordered the door to be locked. There he remained until aid
came from his house. He was only wounded in the neck, and in a few days
was well. Francesco de’ Pazzi and Bernardo Bandini sprang at Giuliano,
who was walking in front of the chapel of the Cross, and with ten or
twelve blows laid him dead on the pavement; they also killed Francesco
Nori, who was with him. The uproar was great in the church. I was there
talking with Messer Bongianni and the other gentlemen, and we were all
struck with astonishment, people flying now here, now there, while the
church resounded with loud shouts, and arms were seen in the hands of
partisans of the Pazzi who had joined in this matter. The Cardinal was
left all alone by the side of the altar, until some priests came and
led him into the old sacristy, where he remained until two of the Eight
with many soldiers arrived and took him to the Palace. At the time this
was happening the Archbishop of Pisa, under the pretence of paying a
visit to the Signory, was at the Palace, and hearing the tumult in
the city, he tried to seize it. With him was his brother Jacopo and
Jacopo his cousin, Jacopo Poggio, the Perugians, and others. But the
Signory and their guard defended themselves and sounded the tocsin, and
the citizens rushed armed into the piazza, and forced a way into the
Palace, the door of which had been closed on the inside, and all were
made prisoners.”</p>

<p>Poliziano describes the agony of suspense of the small group in the new
sacristy, who thought the church was in the hands of the Pazzi. “Some
feared that the priest’s dagger was poisoned, and Lorenzo’s friend,
Antonio Ridolfi, a most excellent youth, sucked the wound in his neck.
Lorenzo, however, gave no heed to it, continually repeating, ‘Is
Giuliano safe?’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span> Then came sharp knocks at the door. ‘We are friends,
we are relations. Let Lorenzo come out ere the enemy gains a foothold.’
We were undecided, and shouted, ‘Enemies or friends? Is Giuliano safe?’
No answer was given. Then Sigismondo Della Stufa, devoted to Lorenzo
since his boyhood, climbed up the ladders into the organ loft, looked
down into the church, and saw the dead body of Giuliano. He recognised
those below as friends, and shouted to us to open the door. Closing
around Lorenzo we led him, so that he should not come past the dead
body, to his house.”</p>

<p>How the Archbishop of Pisa, the Pazzi, and Jacopo Bracciolini were hung
from the windows of the Palace of the Signoria, and how the people
hunted their adherents through the streets, shouting, “<i>Palle! Palle!
down with the traitors</i> and cut them to pieces,” is a matter of
history. Montesecco lay in hiding for some days, and before he was
beheaded in the Palazzo del Podestà, dictated and signed the confession
which throws full light on the participation of Sixtus IV. and his
nephew Girolamo Riario in the plot.</p>

<p>On Ascension Day Giuliano was buried in S. Lorenzo, amid the grief
of the people whose darling he was. “He was tall,” writes Poliziano,
“broad-shouldered, wide-chested, with well-developed and strong arms,
a small waist, powerful thighs, and well-made legs; black, sparkling
eyes, a dark complexion, with thick black hair falling on to his
shoulders. A fine rider, jouster, and dancer, an excellent wrestler
and runner, passionately devoted to the chase, submitting patiently
to want of sleep, to hunger, and to thirst, which he often endured
for a whole day. Magnanimous, steady, pious, and without vice, he
delighted in music, painting, and everything connected with art. He
liked poetry, and wrote some good verse in the vulgar tongue. He
spoke well, but was reserved and not quick-witted; yet he enjoyed
a good joke, and sometimes made one. Liars he hated and those who
nursed vengeance. In dress he was not extravagant, but always neat and
well-clothed. Serious, handsome, and dignified, he was most courteous
and kind-hearted. He adored and revered his brother, while his courage
and high spirits endeared him to the people.”</p>

<p>Vasari tells in his Life of Verrocchio of three waxen images of
Lorenzo, the size of life, made by order of his friends and relations
to commemorate his escape from the dagger of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span> assassin by Arsino,
a celebrated worker in wax, with the help and after the designs
of Verrocchio. “The skeleton inside was of wood, as has been said
elsewhere, with a framework of split canes covered with waxed cloth in
handsome folds, so well arranged that nothing better or more lifelike
can be imagined. The heads, hands, and feet were made of thicker wax,
hollow inside and copied from life, painted in oils, and ornamented
with hair and other necessary things, so natural and so well made, that
they seemed living men and not waxen images, as can be seen in any
of these three. One of them is in the church of the nuns of Chiarito
in Via S. Gallo in front of the miraculous crucifix. This figure is
clothed in the very dress Lorenzo wore when, with his neck bandaged, he
showed himself at the window of his house to the people, who had rushed
there to see whether he was alive, as they hoped, or to avenge him if
dead. The second figure of Lorenzo is clothed in the <i>lucco</i>, the
ordinary dress of the Florentines, and is in the church of the Servites
of the Annunziata above the smaller door, beside which is the table
where candles are sold. The third was sent to S. Maria degl’ Angeli at
Assisi and placed in front of the Madonna, where, as has been already
said, Lorenzo de’ Medici caused the road which goes from S. Maria to
the gate of Assisi and leads to S. Francesco to be laid down in bricks,
and at the same time restored the fountains built by his grandfather
Cosimo at the same place.”<a id="FNanchor_213" href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beloved and great Friends</span>,—We have just heard of the great
and inhuman outrage, opprobrium and injury, which not long ago has
been committed against your Seigneury, against the persons of our
most dear and beloved cousins Lorenzo and Giuliano de’ Medici, their
friends, relations, servants, and adherents, by those of the Pazzi
Bank and their dependants; and of the death of our said cousin
Giuliano de’ Medici, whereby we have been and are as much grieved as
though it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span> had happened to ourselves. Now as your honour and our own
has been so gravely offended, and as the Medici are our relations and
allies, and as we regard this outrage and the death of our cousin
Giuliano as though it had happened to our own person, and therefore
consider the Pazzi guilty of <i>læsæ Majestatis</i>, we cannot permit
this deed to go unpunished; we desire with all our heart that adequate
punishment should follow as an example to others. We have therefore
decided to send to your Excellencies our well-beloved and faithful
Councillor and Chamberlain, Messire d’Argenton,<a id="FNanchor_214" href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a> Seneschal of our
province of Poitou, who is one of the men in whom we have the utmost
confidence, to inform you at length of our wishes; he will tell you
more about this matter. We beg you to place the same trust in him and
the same belief in his words as you would in ours, it is for this that
we send him. I pray God, beloved and great friends, to keep and to
guard you.—12th May 1478.<a id="FNanchor_215" href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a></p>

<p><i>Copy of our Letter sent to the Pope</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Most Holy Father</span>,—We have been fully informed that wantonly
by the hands of Count Girolamo, of one of your nephews recently
promoted to the dignity of the Cardinalate, of the Archbishop of Pisa,
and of members of the Pazzi family and their adherents, an outrage,
insult, and personal attack has been made on the person of our dear
friend Lorenzo de’ Medici and on Giuliano his brother. That the
said Giuliano and others, his friends, have been killed, murdered,
and assassinated in a church in Florence, in which we have been. We
are deeply grieved and still more astonished that such an outrage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>
should have been committed against one of such a House as is that
of the Medici; renowned in the whole world, and known as belonging
to the Church and filling high offices, such as that of Cardinal
and Archbishop, and in the precincts of a Church, a sacred place
dedicated to God. Therefore, Holy Father, we are much displeased at
so abominable a sin and outrage, which we regard as even more grave
than if it had been done to our own person, or to the person of one
nearly related to us, and we hold that your and our honour has been
most deeply offended. On account of the special love we have always
borne, and bear, to the said Lorenzo our cousin and to all of his
House, and of the great friendship, cemented by loyalty, oaths,
and alliance, which in past times existed, and exists at present,
between our predecessors, ourselves, and the city of Florence, we
most affectionately supplicate and pray Your Holiness that for love
of us as well as for love of our Holy Mother Church, in order that
others should not go unpunished, amends shall be made for this crime
by punishing the delinquents, and all who have aided and participated,
in such way that it may be an example for all men to remember, and
that greater ills shall not arise. Otherwise, by virtue of the
said alliance and confederation existing between us and the said
Florentines, and on account of the love we bear to our said cousin,
we have determined to declare against all those who are implicated
and not to allow this thing to go unpunished. We pray the Blessed Son
of God that Your Holiness may long be spared to rule our Holy Mother
Church.<a id="FNanchor_216" href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I wrote to you on the 8th. Since then I have received yours of the
6th, to which I now reply. I thought it best to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span> send the last by a
special courier, because I have heard that the troops of the King
[of Naples] and of the Pope intend making a serious attack, so I
think it will be necessary to gather a larger force here than we had
asked for, as when the enemy comes he will probably come in force.
By yours and Orfeo’s letters we understand that 1000 men have been
engaged and are ready for our service. If this is correct I think it
will suffice if one half crosses our frontier, the rest being held in
readiness for what I mentioned in my last, the assault of Imola. It
must be remembered that in defending ourselves we are defending those
Illustrious Lords [of Milan], and if we gain anything for ourselves
it will be most unexpected, for these Venetian ambassadors declare
that if peace is not made with the Turk we can hope for but small aid
from them. In ten or twelve days we shall have 450 men under arms. If
there is a chance of engaging any condottieri it would be an excellent
thing. I think I am sure of Signor Costanzo and do not believe he will
fail me. Those Illustrious Lords have written to their ambassador
here that they will only subscribe 8000 ducats towards the pay of the
Romagna troop. It seems to me they do wrong to state a given sum, as
this might put off the Venetians, if they say they will subscribe one
third for this troop it can afterwards be settled between ourselves
that we should pay whatever sum is needful beyond the 8000 ducats.
Those Illustrious Lords also seem not to wish to engage Signor
Costanzo, as I heard yesterday. But the negotiation is so far advanced
that not only would it be most unjust to him, but also my motive in
hindering him from serving with the enemy must be considered. If he
only guards and defends his own territory it seems to me it would be
a great advantage to us. In short these gentlemen must be prepared to
disburse the above-mentioned sum and the troops must be ready to move
as I have said. Above all there must be no delay, as our adversaries
are hastening their preparations; if they see that we are strong and
able to resist they may change their minds.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span> From the Venetians I do
not think we shall get other help than those few men on this side of
the Po and their contribution towards the pay of the Romagna troop,
which they appear to give willingly.</p>

<p>Letters from Rome show that although the Pope knows that Cardinal
Riario has been set at liberty, he shows no disposition to raise the
excommunication or the interdict.<a id="FNanchor_218" href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a> This is a bad sign and makes
one believe that he will do all in his power to injure us. We shall
see what will happen and are determined to defend ourselves as well as
we can.</p>

<p>Girolamo left to-day. He came by way of Pontremoli; I reminded him
of your business and he promised me to do all he could. If you pass
through Ferrara I need not tell you what to say to the Duke to keep
him in the same friendly mood towards us he now displays. I say no
more because I know these ambassadors are writing at length.—June 10,

<p><span class="smcap">Lorenzo de’ Medici</span> <i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Giovanni Lanfredini</span>,
<i>Florentine Ambassador at Venice</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I received yours of the 6th this morning and should have waited for
another letter from you with the answer of the Signoria [of Venice],
but from various sources I have heard that the forces of the King and
the Pope are marching to attack us, and so I write at once in order
that you may hasten any aid we can get from Venice. Our ambassador
there will I think send our opinion <i>in scriptis</i> to the
Signoria, who will have to consult with him. We have need of more men
than those who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span> are on this side of the Po. If the Signoria approve
of our plan of attacking Imola in case war is declared against us, we
should prefer that the above-mentioned men should be employed there.
If they do not approve, then it is imperative that the men be sent
with all haste to guard our territory, and we will give orders that
they are to be allowed to cross our frontier. We are most anxious
about this, not on account of the number of men, but in order to prove
to our adversaries that we are united, for they count much on our
disunion. Try therefore to settle this one way or the other and reply
quickly, for the affair is <i>in fieri</i>, and at any moment some
impediment might arise. The Signoria of Venice intimated that they did
not believe the Pope and the King intend to advance; now I conceive
they understand it is true. We have set the Cardinal at liberty, but
the Pope has shown no sign of taking off the excommunications or the
interdicts; on the contrary he maintains them and encourages troops
to attack us. So this is no time for loitering. It would be most
harmful to us if their ambassador left here before his successor was
appointed. We wish this also to be seen to at once. I will have a copy
of the deliberations of the last council sent to you in order that
you may press these matters with all the tact demanded by the customs
there and by the questions themselves.</p>

<p>I wrote thus far yesterday evening. Afterwards we of the
<i>Pratica</i> met, and it was decided not to send our opinions <i>in
scriptis</i>, but to await the reply to those we have sent. More
particularly as our opinion is as follows. On all sides we perceive
signs of incertitude and hesitation in spite of our solicitations to
grant us what they can. If this was cleared up we might hope. If the
Venetians will only make a demonstration in our favour, with small
cost to themselves they would do us a great service, because, as I
have already said, our adversaries believe we are not unanimous in our
desire to defend ourselves, and this makes them more enterprising. We
thought at least<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span> that we should receive help which cost little, as
for example in the affair of submission [to the Pope], particularly as
these ecclesiastical censures still continue, and so that the Signoria
must either incur the same interdict if they help us, or break faith
with us, which however would be absolved by the Bull of the interdict.
As I said before, discover what we can hope for from there, in order
that I may not be again deceived. Present these questions skilfully
so as not to cause any friction; rather leave a part unsaid, for our
great object is to maintain the union of our League in appearance and
in reality.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Most Serene King and especially my Lord</span>,—The letter Your
Majesty has deigned to write about our unhappy case, replete with
great love and paternal benevolence, shows me how keenly you felt our
misfortune, and how kindly disposed you are towards me. Should I even
attempt to return adequate thanks to Your Majesty I should deserve
to be called utterly unfit to understand so great a benefit, because
words so full of love and benevolence coming from Your Majesty to a
humble servant cannot be repaid by any act or word. I can therefore
only beg Your Majesty specially to accept my heartfelt declaration
of loyalty as a token and a pledge of my gratitude, trusting that
God will repay to Your Majesty the rest of my debt. As to Your
Majesty’s wise counsels to bear this calamity with fortitude, you
may rest assured that I do not so much deplore what has happened to
myself as the grave affront to the Christian name; because where I
hoped, in such bitter trouble, to receive help, I found instead the
fountain-head and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span> instigator of all ill. For he, in the presence of
many, dared to confess spontaneously that this crime was caused by
him, and promulgated against me, my children, successors, intimates,
and well-wishers, an iniquitous sentence of excommunication. Not
satisfied with that, he is arming against this Republic, has
instigated King Ferdinand against us, and has urged the King’s eldest
son to march against us with a formidable army in order with violence
and arms to destroy him he could not succeed in utterly ruining by
deceit and fraud. For I well know, and God is my witness, that I
have committed no crime against the Pope, save that I am alive, and
having been protected by the grace of Almighty God have not allowed
myself to be murdered. This is my sin, for this alone have I been
excommunicated and massacred. But I believe that God, scrutiniser of
hearts and most just Judge, who knows my innocence, will not permit
this and will defend me, whom He saved from those sacrilegious hands
in front of His Body, from such unjust calumny. On our side we have
Canon Law, on our side laws natural and political, on our side truth
and innocence, on our side God and men. He has violated all these at
once, and now desires to annihilate us. I write these things to Your
Majesty as to a compassionate father, and from you, on account of
your goodness, piety, and greatness of soul, I have no doubt I shall
receive much help, favour, and military aid, if required. For we
cannot believe that any good man can tolerate that he, who wilfully
precipitates himself into such an abyss of crime, should drag with
him the Christian name. May Your Majesty keep well, to whom I humbly
commend myself—Florence, June 19, 1478.<a id="FNanchor_221" href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sforzie de Bettinis</span>,—I wrote to you this morning. Later I
received yours of the 28th, with news of the arrival of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span> Duke of
Calabria and the others at Todi. We wrote at once to all our troops,
save to those who are already there, to unite and join those of the
Duchess [of Milan] with all speed, part are in the Pisan territory,
the others are on the march; to Giovanni Conti [one of the Milanese
generals], telling him to advance into the territory of Bologna; to
the Venetian contingent to come into that of Faenza. All the others
are to march on Todi. We have asked for two hundred additional
men-at-arms from Milan besides those that are in readiness, and said
that these two hundred are to be placed at once in our pay. With this
letter is sent the number of men and the names of the places where
they are, so that you can direct them wherever you think best. We
have thus done all we can for the moment. You must try and obtain
more certain information whether what you have written is true or
not. If not, you ought not to lack means to discover the dealings
and intentions of the enemy. I think that among them are several who
would willingly do us a service. If you can contrive to interview the
Cavaliere I think you might learn something. Make every effort, for I
cannot believe that you are unable to defend so just a cause.</p>

<p>I understand that the Lord Giovanfrancesco has given orders that the
troops he is to send are to be paid, which will be so much more money.
I am astonished that the Lord Virginio [Orsini, Clarice’s brother]
should give them an escort after replying as he did to that trumpeter,
however I do not think, as I said this morning, that we need despair.
I have no more to add save that you must send us frequent news, and
as true news as you can, and use every means to discover as much as
possible of the movements and intentions of our adversaries. If this
arrival of the Duke of Calabria is true it will probably alter the
plans about which we wrote this morning, and we think it will be
necessary to concentrate our forces as you suggested. Farewell—June

Your Magnificence for accepting my letter in good part.</p>

<p>As to the Lord of Forli it would seem to me wise to make every effort
to draw him to our side for the honour, advantage, and reputation of
our League; the said Lord is clever, and I think, as Your Magnificence
says, he will attempt to get as much money as he can from the Pope,

Illustrious Masters will give all the aid this State can <i>usque ad

might understand that this State was <i>unum velle et unum nolle</i>

this I advise you to do, and to send to meet him without delay at
Bologna, and do what my Masters have written to their ambassador there
and this quickly, so that you may be in time.</p>

<p>It seems to me useless to enlarge on other things, only I beg Your
Magnificence to take heed of your person and to be of good cheer,
because I think there is every indication that things are going well,
and that the Republic, our League, and Your Magnificence, will gain in
reputation; on this side we shall leave nothing undone.</p>

d’Argenton,<a id="FNanchor_224" href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a> with the circumspection and prudence that I know
Your Magnificence possesses, and thus we shall arrive at obtaining,
between my Masters and H.M. the King of France, the essence of what
is contained in those letters, which will redound to your honour,
reputation, and advantage, because our League being strong and united,
and helped by the friendship and reputation of France, things cannot
but go well.</p>

<p>Yesterday morning I obtained possession of some letters from France
written by one Lancilotto of Macedonia to King Ferrante. We find that
King Ferrante has at present four of his people at the French court,
this same Lancilotto, Zohan Copula of <a id="salerno"></a>Salerno, Tommaso Tarquino, who
resides there, and a Messer Antonio de Alexandro, only just arrived
by the route of Catalonia with instructions and mandates of divers
intrigues and plots. I have informed Hieronimo Morelli, ambassador of
their excellencies the Signoria [of Florence] of all, so that he may
write to Your Magnificence, and I am sure he will have done so. I do
not enlarge on this point, because I am sure you will understand and
form a better judgment than I can. I entreat of you to keep my letters
in your own custody and in that of no other man, for I would on no
account that our ambassadors or others should see them for certain
reasons, which are legitimate, to avoid rancour, envy, and calumny,
&amp;c.—Milan, July 3, 1478.<a id="FNanchor_225" href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Magnifice vir</i>,—By your letter of the 1st I see what the Lord
of Forlì has answered. I cannot understand how this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span> difficulty has
arisen, and it is unreasonable. His stipend at present is 8000 ducats,
so he ought to be satisfied with 20,000. Perhaps he does not wish to
serve and tries to throw the blame on us. If this is so I do not see
what his object is in behaving thus. We will not give more than 20,000
ducats with the title of governor of the camp, and the protection of
our League. I have sent again to offer him this, as I had a hint that
he would accept. If he does it will be well, if not I shall cut short
the negotiation, and we will not mention the matter again.</p>

<p>I understand from letters from the Illustrious Lords of Milan that
they encourage Your Magnificence to take steps to obtain the recall of
the Legate. This seems to me perfectly justifiable, our League being
no longer in any way bound to obey the Pope. His presence can only
be harmful and a cause of suspicion. As I am writing I must say that
I heartily approve the advice of those Illustrious Princes and think
Your Magnificence would do well to get rid of the Legate for your own
good and for your reputation, and in order not to appear reluctant in
following the advice of those Illustrious Lords and the wishes of our
Illustrious League. You will gain in credit and security. I commend
myself, &amp;c.—July 4, 1478.<a id="FNanchor_226" href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lorenzo de’ Medici</span> <i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Girolamo Morelli</span>,
<i>Florentine Ambassador at Milan</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Magnifice orator tanquam Pater</i>,—Your letter of the 11th tells
me many things to which I now reply. First, if you do not receive news
day by day the only reason is that I have so much to do that it is
difficult for me to be exact, not to speak of my own dilatory nature.
But I will make every effort to inform you of essential matters every
day. I will do all I can and even a little more.</p>

<p>I understand what the Magnificent Messer Ceccho and Orfeo told you,
and with regard to the affair of Messer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span> Ruberto am exceedingly sorry
that by no fault of mine they and I have such perpetual annoyance
and vexation. Your answer was wise and true. In this business I have
never thought or done anything without first referring to them.
Whether these ambassadors, who have written what I never charged
them to write, have stated the truth I know not. As soon as I heard
the news, and that at Bologna they doubted whether Signor Ruberto’s
father-in-law would give this money, I wrote to Messer Giovanni and
sent you the copy, and I showed these ambassadors the admirable reply
made by Signor Giovanni. Thus those Illustrious Lords will see that
from that moment, for this and many other reasons, Signor Ruberto was
the enemy of those Illustrious Lords, as he was mine. I desire to
clear this matter up once for all and to settle it, for added to all
my other worries it is too much for me to bear.</p>

<p>As to Signor Taddeo we are quite willing to do as you say, but as yet
we have not settled with the Lord of Forlì, as he demands more than we
can well give. We were willing to pay him 25,000 ducats and to give
him the title of Captain-General of our forces. Now he wants double
in time of war, besides making many other dishonest demands. We are
willing to grant anything he asks when he is employed in fighting
outside of Romagna, but not otherwise, and are expecting his answer.
If he does not accept we shall break off negotiations, as we should
lose in money and in reputation. Once this is settled we can treat
with Signor Taddeo, to whom I will write in the meanwhile and find out
what he wants. He is now secretly in Bologna.</p>

<p>We have replied in general terms to King René’s mandate, as he wrote
to us. But privately we have given him to understand that events may
take a course favourable to his designs. I am sure that if the League
decides to undertake anything in that quarter what we have done here
concerning his mandate will be of service to him. I think he intends
to return by Milan in order to see Messer Ceccho, at least so he
wrote to me,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span> and I advised him to do so. From what we hear from the
camp the enemy makes no sign of life. If they do not receive strong
reinforcements, or hopes of some treaty, I think they will do us
little harm. But you had better hurry our contingent there, for whom
you have the money, and see that they are ready and fit to march;
though we hope even without them soon to be as strong as the enemy
is at present. Let us know if our contingent from Brescia has passed
through, they ought to arrive soon.</p>

<p>We had told Signor Giovanni Conte to come here; but he probably left
this morning for the camp as Giovanni di Sapone and Messer Alberto
Visconti are both ill, so he was wanted. His men are following to join
the others. When necessary to send all to him we can do it from here
...<a id="FNanchor_227" href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a> meanwhile those who are ill may recover. But it is absolutely
essential to arrange about a Captain-General who is much needed,
although until now there is perfect order and unity in the camp.</p>

<p>You already know from others my desire about Genoese affairs, and that
I do not think other matters should be imperilled for them. I know
it was unnecessary, but I cannot have done wrong in saying what I
thought. I am still of the same opinion that other people should not
be placed in a dangerous position unless one is sure of success.</p>

<p>The Office has I believe written to you as to the affairs of the camp
and of Montepulciano, as well as about a Brief from the Pope and the
answer to it, so I say no more. I commend myself to you.—Florence,
July 15, 1478.</p>

<p><i>Carissime fili noster at affinis salutem et Apostolicam

propria</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span> and were rejoiced to hear your health was good, which
is what I desire above all things and for which I pray to God,
for nothing is more desirable to us. The letter written by the
Florentines, full of contempt of Christ and of His unworthy Vicar does
not alarm us, but causes us to think that God has destroyed their
intellect and their judgment as a punishment for their sins. We trust
that God, whose honour and glory is at stake, will grant you victory
in everything, especially as our intentions are straightforward
and just. For we make war on no one save on that ungrateful,
excommunicated, and heretical Lorenzo de’ Medici; and we pray to God
to punish him for his iniquitous acts, and to you as God’s minister
deputed to avenge the wrongs he has iniquitously and without cause
committed against God and His Church, with such ingratitude that the
fountain of infinite love has been dried up.</p>

<p>To the Venetians we have replied in proper terms that if they act
unjustly God is above all, and will requite every one according to his
acts.</p>

<p>We have sent many Nuncios with our justification to the King of France
and to other princes, such as the Emperor, the Kings of Hungary and
Spain, and all the others.</p>

<p>Moreover our Bull which has been printed and published to the whole
world will justify us; but allowing that everything goes wrong we
shall rejoice in dying as a martyr and hear every persecution for
love of the Church of God of which we are the unworthy head. We are
sure that when you reflect on what merit you will acquire before God
for defending His Church you will act as a true Christian Prince, and
that my son the Duke of Calabria, together with yourself, will obtain
glory with God and men; the Church will support you who support a just
cause, &amp;c. I am told that some, from ignorance or malignity, depict
me as of hell; this I do not refute, but only despise their words,
confiding in thy fidelity who wilt not abandon God and me, who trust
in thee, so I let who will talk.</p>

<p>These French ambassadors are, they say, coming to us, let us hope that
God may inspire us with suitable answers, all which shall be notified
to you. Salute my illustrious son the Duke of Calabria cordially from
me. For him, as for you, we pray continually to God. I wish thee good
health, most beloved cousin.—July 25, 1478.</p>

<p>They threaten schism and disobedience. God’s will be done: but it
might be desirable that you write to the King of England, and that
King Ferdinand should write to his colleagues and to the King of
France, as he in his prudence will know how to do in proper terms.<a id="FNanchor_229" href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a></p>

<p>I hear from Naples that the King continues to molest me and my affairs
as much as he can by not allowing me to encash and desiring me to pay.
I fear that as soon as the Pope hears of these attempts to provoke
disobedience he will make some move against my affairs at Rome.
Although I think the imminent peril has passed over as I have very
considerable credit there, yet I wish that with the utmost caution
and care, and so secretly that none but Messer Ceccho should know,
you would find out whether I can count upon 30,000 or 40,000 ducats
for six or seven months in case of need. I do not expect they will be
wanted because, as I said, I think all the ill that could be done to
me there has been done, and till now I have been able to provide for
everything. Yet, for my own tranquillity I should like to know this,
and I have not the least fear that it will be refused. See that you
find out at once and let me know, acting with all the caution and
secrecy necessary in such business. I have in Rome Antonio and the
Portinari, nevertheless I confide this to you alone, and have written
with my own hand in order that none should<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span> know. I wish, as I said,
that you should arrange this with Messer Ceccho without either he or
you conferring with others. I shall be able to face the many troubles
I have with much more courage if I know that I can count on this help.
If I do need it I will give every obligation and bond.—In Florence on

<p>In 1478, after the Pazzi conspiracy, when the Pope was stirring up war
against the Medici he hated, Lorenzo sent his wife and children to
Pistoja, where they were the guests of the Panciaticchi, for safety.
With them went Angelo Poliziano as tutor to Piero the eldest boy,
then about six years of age. The stiff, proud Roman, Madonna Clarice,
had never known how to gain her husband’s love, and did not get on
well with his brilliant, sarcastic, rather Bohemian friends. She
particularly disliked Poliziano’s growing influence over Piero, and
at the end of the year there was an open rupture, when she dismissed
him with scant courtesy. One pities them both. Clarice, already far
gone in consumption, was irritable and anxious about her husband,
whose attitude towards the Holy See she, with her education, could not
approve; while Poliziano, used to the brilliant talk in the Medici
palace, where he measured his wit with Luigi Pulci, Matteo Franco,
Marsilio Ficino, Pico della Mirandola, &amp;c., and Lorenzo himself, was
bored to death and always longing to be back in Florence. The letters
from the little boy to his father show how simple was the family life
of the Magnificent Lorenzo, indeed he is blamed by Machiavelli for
joining in childish games with his children and for being seen playing
with them.</p>

<p><i>Magnifica Domina mea</i>,—The news we can send you from here are
these. That the rain is so heavy and so continuous that we cannot
leave the house and have exchanged hunting for playing at ball, so
that the children should have exercise. Our stakes are generally the
soup, the sweet, or the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span> meat; and he who loses goes without; often
when one of my scholars loses he pays tribute to Sir Humid.<a id="FNanchor_244" href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a> I
have no other news to give you. I remain in the house by the fireside
in slippers and a greatcoat, were you to see me you would think I
was melancholy personified. Perhaps I am but myself after all, for
I neither do, nor see, nor hear anything that gives me pleasure so
much have I taken our calamities to heart. Sleeping and waking they
haunt me. Two days ago we began to spread our wings for we heard the
plague had ceased; now we are again depressed on learning that it
still lingers. When at Florence we have some sort of satisfaction, if
nought else that of seeing Lorenzo come home in safety. Here we are
in perpetual anxiety about everything. As for myself I declare to you
that I am drowned in weary sloth, such is my solitude. I say solitude
because Monsignore<a id="FNanchor_245" href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a> shuts himself up in his room with only his
thoughts for company, and I always find him so full of sorrow and
apprehension that my melancholy is only increased in his company. Ser
Alberto di Malerba mumbles prayers with these children all day long,
so I remain alone, and when I am tired of study I ring the changes on
plague and war, on grief for the past and fear for the future, and
have no one with whom to air my phantasies. I do not find my Madonna
Lucrezia in her room with whom I can unbosom myself and I am bored
to death. Our sole relief is in letters from Florence, from Malerba,
who has written these last few days, but I must tell you he generally
sends good news which we believe for a little while, such is our
desire that they may be true. But these plums usually turn into sloes.
However I am trying to arm myself with hope and cling to everything
in order not to sink to the bottom. I have nought else to say. I
commend myself to Your Magnificence.—Cafaggiuolo, December 18, 1478.

<p><span class="smcap">Most Serene and Excellent Lord my King</span>: after humble
recommendation, &amp;c.,—I have been informed during the last few days
that your Majesty wrote me a letter full Of affection and benevolence
at that terrible time when my beloved brother Giuliano was so cruelly
torn from me in the centre of the church, and when I was wounded.
This letter, I know not why, never reached me; would to God it had,
for the emotion evinced by so great a King would have been a great
comfort to me when I was oppressed by such a terrible sorrow. Had I
only known that the letter had been sent by your Majesty and delayed
in the journey, it would have been no small comfort, and I should
have at once thanked your Majesty for such a proof of kindly feeling
towards me. Even now I send most heartfelt thanks and express my
deep obligation. I desire nothing more than that an opportunity may
arise for me to show my devotion to your Majesty. It is far beyond
my power to repay not alone the letter, but even the slightest sign
from so great a King, all I can do is to place myself entirely at your
Majesty’s orders. I commend myself ever to your Majesty O my Lord and
King, and beg to be taken under the shadow of your wings. Your Majesty
is I know fully acquainted with our affairs. We are preparing for war
and working hard to be able to resist the forces of the enemy. Resist
we shall, as I hope, because we shall not fail to ourselves, and I
trust God will aid the good cause. Again I commend myself to your
Majesty, whom may God preserve in happiness.—Florence, April 3, 1479.

greeting.</p>

<p>Our little friend Piero writes you about what is happening here
at Cafaggiuolo; it is my part to explain that his last letter was
not, like the previous ones, submitted to me for suggestions while
he composed it and then a fair copy made. It was completed in one
sitting, as the saying is, and by himself alone. I only suggested in
course of conversation what he should write about. The words and the
composition are all his own.</p>

<p>I am training him in such a way that I have no fear but that he will
fulfil the expectations I have formed of him, although you fear his
excessive impetuosity.</p>

<p>As for Giovanni, you will have seen for yourself. His mother has taken
it upon herself to change his course of reading to the Psalter, a
thing I did not approve of. While she was absent he had made wonderful
progress. He was already able to select, without any help from me, all
the letters and syllables in his exercise in composition.</p>

<p>My only petition to God is that I may be able to prove to you some day
my loyalty, diligence, and patience. This I would willingly purchase
even at the expense of death.</p>

<p>I omit much lest I should weary your busy mind.</p>

my departure I should wish, indeed I beg of you as a grace, to explain
by word of mouth, it is too long to write. When you have heard me I
think you will admit that all the fault is not mine. Out of respect,
and not wishing to come to Florence <i>præter jussa tua</i>, I am
here to await the commands of your Magnificence as to what I am to
do, because I am yours even if the whole world was against me. If I

one who obtains what he asks for will win. Till now Lucrezia has had
all she wished for. I, who have always written in Latin in order to
give a more literary tone to my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span> letters, have not yet had that pony
you promised me; so that I am laughed at by all. See to it therefore,
Your Magnificence, that she should not always be the winner. The war
as far as I understand goes in our favour this year, but we do not
quite understand how the sword that wounded us is to be broken if
only the sheath is hit. For if the enemy makes war on us even outside
his own country, on what does he rely for again attacking us another
year when tired out. We only hope for peace through victory. Scipio
is to be driven to Carthage in order to get Hannibal out of Italy. We
beseech you, we your children, to have the more care for yourself the
more you see that the enemy rather lays hidden snares than dares open
warfare.</p>

<p>I commend Martino to you, who aids me not to forget my Greek and
to improve my Latin.<a id="FNanchor_251" href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a> He would have been named chaplain of S.
Lorenzo by his patrons, Antonio and Lorenzo Tornabuoni, had not Your
Magnificence recommended another. It is but just that they should
bestow their patronage on their own people, and not be prevented in
so doing by you, who in general give to others what is yours. I hope
therefore to have letters recommending my Martino to those to whom he
has already recommended himself. God save you.—26th May 1479.</p>

I told you that if you wished him to remain I was perfectly content,

<p>We are all well and studying. Giovanni is beginning to spell. By this

Giuliano laughs and thinks of nothing else; Lucrezia sews, sings, and
reads; Maddalena knocks her head against the wall, but without doing
herself any harm; Luisa begins to say a few little words; Contessina
fills the house with her noise. All the others attend to their duties,
and nothing is wanting to us save your presence. We hear that things
are better than last year, and hope that you being well there will be
nought but victory in the future. Strong and brave men are not good at
subterfuges but shine in open warfare. Thus we confide in you, as we

a farthing, if he had anything he spent it here in clothes, and now we
repay him with “Go in peace.” Nothing could be more displeasing to me.
Whoso wants to do as they wish should not be born a woman. I should
be so glad if you will ask Lorenzo, if not inconvenient, to give him
shelter where he would not be in the way for two or three months until
the plague has ceased. I do not think he is capable of teaching any
save the little ones, whom he might look after and teach. You could
not do me a greater pleasure, as it will show that I have some one
who is willing to oblige me; there are others who do the reverse.
If during this time he should be in need of a little money for his
clothes I will provide it from my own pocket, for he seems to me in a
bad plight. Here I could give him nothing as I had no money. I should
be glad if any small sum comes into your hands or any small living you

years. I have not written before as I feared to importune you and also
because I have sent often to your house to Marco for malvasy and for
the book of St. Margaret, all of which I have received; and from him I
heard news of you. I should have sent to you [at Careggi] but thought
that on account of the plague you would keep close<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span> guard. We have had
it near here, but by the grace of God it is now finished. So I did
not send as I ought to have done. As I told you in Florence I mean
to lie in here for I know you have enough on your hands, and I want
for nothing. If I am worse than usual which I do not expect as by the
grace of God I am very well, I am in the ninth month now and as I said
well, should anything unforeseen happen there is Maestro Giorgio close
by who fled here from the plague. So be in no anxiety about me for I
feel sure God will assist me as ever, if it so pleases Him. Of the
family in the Mugello I hear good news, which rejoices me, and also
of Nannina,<a id="FNanchor_262" href="#Footnote_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a> who they tell me passed along the road going to the
Casentino. I am so glad you are all of you well, which is not little
to say in such times as these, for I was and I am anxious about you as
you said you had to see so many people. I wonder you were not somewhat
afraid, but our Lord God will not abandon us entirely. Do persuade
Lorenzo to take more care, for I hear he has no fear at all<a id="FNanchor_263" href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a> ...
on all sides, and also to beware of his enemies. Until this sickness
is past he ought to put his pleasures on one side; if he lives he will
have more than now, for I trust God will recompense him for the ill

<p>The following extracts from Vespucci’s letters to the “Ten” allude
to the one victory gained by the Florentine troops over the Prefect
of Rome, nephew of Pope Sixtus IV., near Lake Trasimene during the
war between Florence and the Pope with his ally the King of Naples,
in 1479. But the fortune of war soon changed. The Florentines were
beaten at Poggibonsi, within sixteen miles of Florence, by the Duke of
Calabria. Fortunately for her, Duke Alfonso stopped to lay siege to the
small walled town of Colle which held out for two months and inflicted
considerable loss on his army. Meanwhile the summer, generally
considered in the fifteenth century to be the only proper time for
fighting, was over; the Duke offered a three months’ truce, withdrew
his troops to winter quarters, and Florence was saved.</p>

<p>When the King of France heard the news he gave signs of great joy,
kneeling as is his wont three times and kissing the ground, thanking
God. All that day he talked of nought else with his people, saying:
“My friends the Florentines and my cousin Lorenzo de’ Medici will
have their revenge this year....” You heard how the King’s Majesty
had received news of the glorious victory of our troops near Perugia
and how delighted he was, so that according to what I hear from
court he showed extreme pleasure both by actions and in words, to
the great content of the Magnificent Monsignor of Argenton<a id="FNanchor_268" href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a> who,
as though he had been a born Florentine, continually <i>tamquam

goes about Paris proclaiming our victory; particularly to those
ecclesiastics whom I have met sometimes at supper with his Lordship.</p>

<p>Vespucci adds that Louis XI. refused to receive a certain Raffaello
Ballerini sent by the Pope to explain his actions, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span> that when
King Ferrante asked that his galleys might use the ports of Nice and
Provence for the purpose of attacking the Florentines, the Duke of
Savoy by command of the King of France refused his consent.—1479.<a id="FNanchor_269" href="#Footnote_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a></p>

<p>Yours of the 8th and 9th tell me that everything goes well there.
It is useless for me to say much as we must wait to see how affairs
shape themselves and try to turn them in our favour. I cannot believe
that the Lord Lodovico being all-powerful and an absolute ruler will
consent to our undoing, because it would be against his interest. He
is by nature kindly and has never received any injury from us either
public or private. It is true that he obtained power by the King’s
favour, but I think he is even more beholden to the help given him
by others and to his own qualities. From the little I know of His
Lordship he seems to me capable of understanding what is right and
willing to execute what he understands. Therefore as soon as you can
it would be well to see His Lordship and demonstrate to him that on
account of ancient friendship we expect nothing but good from him,
there being no reason for antagonism, and according to my view it
will be his interest. Impress upon him that this city desires to go
hand in hand with the State of Milan, that is with His Lordship, and
for this reason beg and encourage him to inform you in some measure
of his intentions so that we may act in conformity with his wishes.
Explain our difficulties to him, and how they react upon that State,
and the remedy which is in his own hands. This is what I have to say
at present. As soon as I received your first intimation I despatched
Niccolò d’Antonio Martelli, who is very intimate with His Lordship,
it was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span> through him that formerly I transacted all important affairs
with His Lordship. I send him to you to whom he will show all his
despatches. He will soon be with you, as to-day he must be at Bologna.
It appears to me that we must now throw ourselves entirely into the
arms of His Lordship and discover as soon as possible what are his
ideas and his intentions towards us, and this quickly, for I have
had no letter from him. I have thought it better to write to him and
enclose the letter, but I rely more on your interview with him, when
you can tell him as much as you think fit of what I have written. I
commend myself to you.—Florence, September 11, 1479.</p>

<p>I must remind you of what I wrote yesterday about the Marquis of
Mantua. If he is deposed that country will immediately be included
among our enemies, it would be our ruin.</p>

<p>In November Niccolò Martelli, the trusted friend of Lorenzo, was
still in Milan, and on the 12th Lodovico Sforza (il Moro) told him to
inform Lorenzo that the King of Naples would be willing to listen to
overtures of peace, and that he strongly advised him to strike while
the iron was hot. Ten days later he told the same thing to Pier Filippo
Pandolfini, the Florentine ambassador, adding that Lorenzo ought not
to trust Venice who thought only of her own interests, and would leave
Florence in the lurch. He could himself promise little or nothing as
Milan was sore pressed, and he wished Lorenzo to know this, in order
to avoid future recrimination. He advised immediate action, and was
ready to undertake negotiations with Naples. It is clear that Lodovico
had been charged by King Ferrante to sound Lorenzo. On November 24th
Filippo Strozzi, who had lived long in Naples and knew the King well,
left Florence on a secret mission. “I was to tell the King,” he writes
in his journal, “that Lorenzo placed himself in the King’s hands,
and would willingly do all the King desired if he only gave peace to
Florence, and restored to her the towns she had lost. I found H.M. at
Arnone [at the mouth of the Volturno] hunting, and when I delivered my
message he answered that he had later<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span> news; that Lorenzo was coming
in person, and so we would wait and see what his visit would bring
forth.”<a id="FNanchor_271" href="#Footnote_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a></p>

<p>The following letter from Lorenzo to the Signoria was written after
he had started for Naples. Many in Florence feared that he might meet
the same fate as Piccinino, who had been invited to Naples and foully
murdered by the King’s orders.</p>


<p><i>To the</i> <span class="smcap">Signoria</span> <i>of Florence, from</i> <span class="smcap">Lorenzo
de’ Medici</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Most Illustrious my Lords</span>,—It is not from presumption that
I did not notify the reason of my departure to Your Illustrious
Excellencies, but because it seemed to me that the agitated and
disturbed condition of our city demands acts and not words. I conceive
that she desires, and indeed has extreme need of peace. Seeing that
all other endeavours have been fruitless, I have determined to run
some peril in my own person rather than expose the city to disaster.
Therefore, with the permission of Your Excellencies of the Signoria,
I have decided to go openly to Naples. Being the one most hated and
persecuted by our enemies I may by placing myself in their hands
be the means of restoring peace to our city. One of two things is
certain, either His Majesty the King loves our city as he has asserted
and some have believed, and is attempting to gain our friendship by
affronting us rather than by despoiling us of liberty; or His Majesty
really desires the ruin of this Republic. If his intentions are
good there is no better way of testing them than by placing myself
voluntarily in his power, and I make bold to say that this is the only
way to make peace and to render the condition of our city stable.
If His Majesty the King intends to attack our liberty it seems to
me well to know the worst quickly, and that one should be injured
rather than the many. I am most glad to be that one, for two reasons:
first, because<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span> being the principal object of our enemies’ hatred I
can more easily and better explain all to the King, as it may be that
our enemies only seek to injure me. The other reason is that having
a greater position and larger stake in our city, not only than I
deserve but probably than any citizen in our days, I am more bound
than any other man to give up all to my country, even my life. These
are the feelings with which I go, for perchance our Lord God desires
that this war, which began with the blood of my brother and my own,
should be put an end to by me. My ardent wish is that either my life
or my death, my misfortunes or my well-being, should contribute to the
good of our city. I shall therefore carry out my idea. If it succeeds
according to my wishes and hopes I shall be most glad to benefit my
country at the risk of my life and at the same time to save myself.
Should evil befall me I shall not complain if it benefits our city, as
it certainly must; for if our adversaries only aim at me, they will
have me in their hands: if they want aught else it will be patent
to all. I am certain that our citizens will unite to protect their
liberty, so that by the grace of God it will be defended as was always
done by our fathers. I go full of hope, and with no other object than
the good of the city, and I pray God to give me grace to perform what
is the duty of every man towards his country. I commend myself humbly
to Your Excellencies of the Signoria.—From San Miniato on the 7th day
of December 1479. Your Excellencies’ Servant,</p>

<p><i>Magnifice tanquam Pater</i>,—From S. Miniato I wrote to tell you
the reason of my departure, but as a note from you does not mention my
letter, perhaps you will have had it later.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span></p>

<p>Anyhow I reply briefly to assure you that your affairs and those
of your and my Illustrious Lord are most dear to me, and that at
present and in the future they are and ever will be more so. I know
my obligations towards His Excellency, and know what is my duty,
which I shall perform. Wherever Lorenzo de’ Medici intervenes Your
Lordship may be sure that there is one of your most faithful servants.
His Excellency will know this from the effects if I succeed in doing
what I wish. Meanwhile this is to inform Your Magnificence that I
hope to leave here to-night and to join the galleys, which arrived
this evening, at dawn. On board is Ser Giantommaso Caraffa, son of
the Count di Matalone, and Prinzivalle di Gennaro, whose position at
the court of the Duke of Calabria I think you are aware of. They have
come to bear me company, though a far greater man than I am would be
much honoured by their companionship. I pray God may lead me there and
bring me back in safety, having accomplished something. I beg you to
let Your Illustrious Lords and Madonna know what I have written, and I
commend myself to their Excellencies and to you.—Pisa, the 10th day
of December 1479.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Magnifice Pater mi</i>,—I send herewith a duplicate of the mandate
in case the first has not reached you, your primary instructions and
the letter of credit. I think however that you will have received them
as Poccia had a safe-conduct from the Duke.</p>

<p>As you are to use them I hope they are according to your wishes. If
anything is wanting I beg you to send me the formula you desire and it
shall be sent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span></p>

<p>I also send you a cipher if you want to write anything secret.</p>

<p>How things go at Sarzana owing to the return of Ser Alessandro you
will see by the letter of the 10th. The Duke of Calabria continues
the same line of conduct with letters and mandates drawn up like an
agreement for peace. It does not seem to me to promise well. Deal
with it as you think best. We have more adversaries in this matter
than is pleasant, and maybe he who ought to favour us does not do so,
but craftily acts against us in the interests of others. I cannot now
write more openly, another time I will explain at greater length in
cipher.</p>

<p>Your letter of the 18th rejoiced us all, and peace seemed imminent.
That of the 22nd altered the outlook and gave rise to grave thought
in those who heard it. The reply was debated on for several days. You
will see what was decided. Only to you would such large powers be
given in so important a matter. It is the first time a white sheet
[unlimited authority] has been given, for it amounts to that. But as
it is to you that such a commission is sent no one doubts that good
will come of it. I, as your devoted friend, point out that whatever
was not carried through here at once has been completed by the
authority given to you in the last paragraph of your letter. Peace
would be most welcome here, but if the conditions are not honourable
you know our nature; we praise or we blame according to which way
the wind blows or our feelings move us. We do not trouble to reason.
The Milanese appear favourable but there [at Naples] you will know
better about this. Venice will I think not be satisfied with anything
which would be displeasing to us. But you understand all this better
than I can explain it so I will not enter into more particulars, as
I know you are kept minutely informed by others. I commend myself to
you.—Florence, January 1, 1479 (1480).<a id="FNanchor_274" href="#Footnote_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Magnifice Benefactor mi</i>,—I take the keenest delight for many
reasons in your letters, both in those you write to me and in those
written to the Ten. <i>In primis</i> for the hope you give both
in public and in private of good results. God will not frustrate
your work <i>et ricordabitut servi sui</i>. You are satisfied with
the mandate so I am content. In former times things pertaining to
knighthood were much prized there [at Naples]. This is why I acted as
I did. I am not at all vexed, how could I be with anything you do with
regard to public things or with regard to myself, who owe everything
to you and to whom I would give my life?</p>

<p>The affairs of Milan have put new life into some people here, they
are well known and much discussed. You will see by the copies the
Office sends what has arrived here. But there are those who do not put
much faith in words when gainsaid by deeds. Nevertheless the general
opinion is that they desire to keep that duck and make it grow,
because reason and duty must at last prevail. I tell you this in order
that you should insist as much as you can on honourable conditions
of peace, so that no one here will be able to say that your going to
Naples has made things worse, as a few have already tried to induce
others to believe and say: You know how many we are, but boys, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Enclosed is a mandate from the Lord of Faenza. He has talked to me and
displays great faith in you, nevertheless I see he is much alarmed,
and suspicious of that prince [Duke of Milan?]. A Venetian ambassador
is at Faenza with 200 soldiers as a guard. I had the same suspicion,
and suspected others as well, as I have told you before, and now it is
increased by what has happened at Rimini. Although Pesaro has always
followed our lead, yet suspicions and State jealousies have great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span>
influence on men’s minds. We must carefully consider what security
can be given to pacify them, particularly as lies are told about
everything as one knows is always the case in such important affairs.</p>

<p>Your dealings with H.M. the King about the restitution of Sarzana is
much commended. If it can be obtained before peace is concluded, for
every one here had lost all hope and even doubted that peace would be
made, you would gain much honour and all would be attributed to you.</p>

<p>Here everything goes on as when you left, there is still some
ill-humour, but it is I think a good sign that it is less apparent
than when you were here. Your reputation seems to have increased and
if all ends as we desire and you give us hopes—<i>nihil supra</i>. I
commend myself to you.—From the Palace [Florence], January 12, 1479
(1480).</p>

<p>News has reached here written from there [Naples] to private
individuals in Rome, by, I have been told, persons in your suite,
<i>sunt pleni rimarum</i> written by them in Naples. If you think this
matters admonish them, but without mentioning me, for as you know we
live in glass houses.<a id="FNanchor_275" href="#Footnote_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Magnifice Pater benefactor mi</i>,—We are all hoping against hope
for the conclusion of this affair which has delayed so long, as you
will see by the letter of the Ten. Letters from Rome come often to our
merchants which addle our brains, not only do they vary every time,
but are contradictory. The Pope will never consent. The Count agrees
to everything. The Pope agrees, the Count will not hear of it, &amp;c.
The news is crumbled into a thousand bits. Messer Lorenzo da Castello
has gone to lay the land waste, also he has gone to set things right,
also to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span> clear up matters, in short infinite are the opinions and the
whims. For the love of God get us out of this by the good offices of
him [King of Naples] on whom we are to depend in future; for his power
and authority are such that finally every one will have to do as he
pleases. The Ten desire your return either with peace or without,
but more with peace. This long delay is grievous to them and to all,
especially to your friends. Yet, notwithstanding, hope and faith in
H.M. the King grows day by day and affection towards you. And as it
appears <i>agat partes nostras</i> in this treaty of peace against our
other adversaries, I encourage this opinion as much as I can, because
it seems to me beneficial to our public and private needs. Everything
here is quiet and in the same condition as when you left, as I told
you before. If there is peace you will see how the city will flourish.
I commend myself to you.—Florence, January 15, 1479 (1480), <i>quam

a day and that we are now searching for an increased supply. Being
anxious to meet your wishes and to prevent the said water from
escaping from whence it rises as I found had been the case, whereby
much of its virtue is lost, I caused the building made for Giovanni
di Pace to be demolished, and at the bottom, nearly in the centre
of the Bath, I found another spring and several smaller ones which
will give much water, and are exactly the same as that of <i>Caccio
cotto</i>, which<a id="FNanchor_279" href="#Footnote_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a> ... give twenty barrels, or more.<a id="FNanchor_280" href="#Footnote_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a> The
ingredients contained in the said water are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span> sulphur and some alum.
It is excellent for scabies and for asthma, it is a dissolvent,
heals all ills in the body and pains in the joints and the nerves.
Many other virtues are contained in it as I will demonstrate to Your
Magnificence. Also of the other springs, particularly that of the
principal bath, you shall have exact descriptions, for I am analysing
the said waters with all diligence, and in three days I hope to finish
this work entrusted to me. I commend myself to Your Magnificence.—The

some time I have not written to Your Magnificence, now I write to
tell you: that this evening news has come from H.M. the King [of
Naples] that the Turkish army has arrived in Apulia and has already
seized more than twenty towns and castles, and taken prisoners more
than fifteen thousand inhabitants, whom they have butchered in most
cruel fashion. They are said now to be encamped before a port called
Oitontoto [Otranto], where they have disembarked ten thousand men
and more than four thousand horses, and have planted many mortars
with which they are bombarding the walls. The opinion of those who
have been there is that by now the town is lost. This news has made
a great sensation here and is held to be very serious. God help us
in our need: for I see it will cause the affairs of Italy to be
forgotten.<a id="FNanchor_283" href="#Footnote_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a></p>

Magnificence of the 26th of last month, and informed you of what had
happened until now.</p>

<p>Now I must tell Your Magnificence that this morning while visiting
the ambassador of H.M. the King to hear whether there was any fresh
news, he told me that he had heard from the Venetian ambassador that
the Turkish camp which was at Rhodes had been broken up, and the army
had returned to Constantinople, the Venetian ambassador said he had
letters to this effect. If true, this seems to me good news.</p>

<p>On Monday morning a school-building here fell and it was feared that
more than twenty boys had been killed. But only the master perished,
which is looked upon as a great miracle. The loud screams of the
fathers and the mothers cannot be described. God, at that moment,
shielded innocence. He continues to work great wonders. Let us pray
that He will not look at our great sins.</p>

<p>Messer Antonio Ridolfi, the ambassador of our Republic, bears himself
in such guise that all the citizens are much indebted to him, he never
ceases day or night to solicit and press forward their affairs. I have
hopes in Almighty God and His glorious Mother the Virgin Mary that he
may return with great honour and an end be put to so much tribulation.
May God be pleased to do this.</p>

<p>By my letter of the 23rd of last month I suggested, in case you and
the Magnificent Lorenzo approved, that His Magnificence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span> should write
a letter to the Cardinal of Milan and one to the Cardinal of Portugal
advising and begging them to accelerate this holy enterprise; for
although they are well disposed yet I know it would help matters
much. I see their Seigneuries often and they are favourably inclined.

his brothers are satisfied. I do not feel that I need trouble Your
Serenity with any explanations about this business as I have written
to Giovanni Frescobaldi [Florentine ambassador at Venice] to explain
some points by which Your Serenity will see that I have fulfilled
<i>ad unquem</i> the obligations imposed on me by those known to Your
Excellency. I beg humbly that you will deign to listen favourably to
the reasons Giovanni will state in my defence and to rest assured that
as I have never yet broken faith with any man I shall not be found
wanting in far more important affairs than those now under discussion
by those Magnificent Citizens. I trust that the friendship that has
always existed between us will be preserved by the intervention of
those who have concluded this business between us and will enable me
to continue to act according to my precepts. I confide in the great
goodness and clemency of Your Serenity when you hear my justification,
and I desire and hope to retain the good opinion and the friendship
of Your Excellency, which has been gained by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</span> long service
of my ancestors and myself to that Illustrious State and to Your
Serenity.—1480. To whom, &amp;c.<a id="FNanchor_286" href="#Footnote_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albino my dear and good Brother</span>,—I cannot decide whether
your letters of 2nd and 8th May give me more pleasure than pain. With
the strongest desire for the fame of our Lord Duke, which has begun so
well by the good beating of those Turkish dogs on the 18th, comes a
fear that His Lordship may not come to some harm by his courage. Those
skirmishes which you describe, at which His Lordship often assists,
made me turn pale more than once, for I have read and re-read your
letter. If possible, my Albino, send us news often, and implore His
Lordship to be cautious. I will say no more because I feel nervous
as I write. Bid him to take care of his person for the sake of God
and himself, and for us his servants, and do what is needful at the
peril of others and not of his own. You, who are by his side, must
see to this even at the price of your own life, and if you do not
on your own account do it for mine, if you love me. Commend me to
His Lordship. I anxiously await your reply to hear whether this my
friendly recommendation has any effect without hindering what I look
upon as certain, and that is that His Lordship will return from the
expedition wreathed with laurels. So I expect from day to day to have
your news.—Florence, May 18, 1481.</p>

<p>These and other extracts from despatches of the various Ferrarese
ambassadors are inserted as they give such vivid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</span> pictures of Lorenzo
and of the condition of Florence. Day by day rumours, gossip, and their
own conversations with Lorenzo were noted down for the information of
their master Ercole d’Este, Duke of Ferrara and Modena.</p>


<p><i>From</i> <span class="smcap">Bartolommeo Sgnippi</span>, <i>Clerk of the Embassy,
to</i> <span class="smcap">Antonio Montecatino</span>, <i>Ambassador of the Duke of
Ferrara (who had gone to Ferrara for a few days) to the Florentine
Republic</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Magnificent Ambassador</span>,—I make known unto you that the
day before yesterday in the evening a certain Moroto Baldovinetto
was arrested, and yesterday morning Battista Frescobaldi, who were
about to assassinate the Magnificent Lorenzo de’ Medici with poisoned
daggers. Their ancestors were great people, but these fellows are
of no standing. Moroto was at Rome several days with Count Girolamo
(Riario) and has only just returned; as yet it is not known whether
the Count is mixed up in the affair ... June 3, 1481.<a id="FNanchor_289" href="#Footnote_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a></p>

<p>The confession of these two ruffians who wanted to assassinate the
Magnificent Lorenzo and who were hung this morning at eleven o’clock
in the palace of the Bargello, is that Baptista Frescobaldi, the
man who arrested Bernardo Bandini at Constantinople,<a id="FNanchor_290" href="#Footnote_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a> told the
Magnificent Lorenzo that he had spent so much for the said arrest
and that he did not consider the Magnificent Lorenzo had paid him
<i>secundum eius rationem</i> and claimed more money, which was
refused. Seeing that he could not revenge himself in any other way six
months ago he determined to murder the said Magnificent Lorenzo. Being
at Rome he spoke about it to Neri Acciaiuoli who encouraged him to do
the evil deed. Moroto being at the same time at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</span> Rome the two began to
talk about the government of Florence. Knowing Moroto to be a man of
great courage, Neri persuaded him <i>ad idem scelsus</i>. Aware that
such an undertaking could not succeed without accomplices he brought
Moroto and Battista together and thus it was settled. They suggested
telling Count Girolamo,<a id="FNanchor_291" href="#Footnote_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a> but Neri said it would be better to
say nothing as the Count, having been blamed enough already, would
certainly refuse to join. But he would undertake to provide <i>quod
ille nunquam deficeret, et etiam</i> would get Obietto (del Fiesco)
to lend them men-at-arms, and when everything was ready, would come
to Castellina and double the pay for every eventuality in Romagna.
He hinted at help from other people and said he had influential and
well-known citizens at his back. Now though all this was told to them
by Neri, in their confession they declared they did not much believe
in him, but thought he did it to encourage them. Through him they
obtained a few arms and some money, for it appears that Moroto on
being asked whether he had arms said he had a cuirass in pawn. They
were given certain chain mail, and stuff for poisoning daggers which
he brought to them in a small phial with soap on the top. When they
arrived here they tried, following their instructions, to persuade a
few hot-headed opponents of the government, &amp;c., to join, but without
entering into particulars, save with Francesco Balducci. To him they
unbosomed themselves and he promised every help. Balducci having
fled, his brother, to whom he had told the project, was arrested. It
seems that <i>post multas cogitationes tandem</i> they settled to do
the deed on one of the three days of the coming feast of the Holy
Spirit in the church of S. Liberata, and afterwards to take refuge
in some safe house until part of the people had risen. Then, with a
banner taken from a church with the arms of the Commune, to parade
the streets crying “<i>Viva il Popolo</i>,” &amp;c., <i>et præsertim</i>
in the lower parts of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</span> the city to breach casks of wine for the
poor. Battista was deputed to give the blow, the other two were to
defend him. It appears Moroto only joined, persuaded by the words
of Neri, for the honour and glory of the thing. They are considered
<i>hominis insani</i>. The shirts of mail belonging to them were
found. This is all that is known of their confession and they say
no one else is implicated either here or abroad. Three have been
hung, Francesco Baldovinetto, Moroto, and the brother of Francesco
Balducci.—Florence, June 6, 1481.<a id="FNanchor_292" href="#Footnote_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a></p>
</div>

<p>The ambassador hastened back to Florence and wrote to the Duke.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I arrived here on the 6th, at one of the night, and found that the
three who had conspired to assassinate Lorenzo had been hung that
morning.... It is stated that they had no sympathisers in the city but
acted like reckless and desperate men ... though they sounded many
they found none willing to listen. I believe people were afraid: but
if the deed had succeeded everything would have been topsy-turvy—of
this I have no doubt. They showed great hopes and determination. When
told they were to die next morning several citizens visited them and
exhorted them to take courage. They answered laughing that they feared
not death, but that they were grieved not to have been able to free
them from such servitude and had only done what any other citizen
ought to do, and that if they were only given two hours of freedom
they would show what they could do. It is supposed, although not
admitted, that others in the city are implicated. They say it does
not appear that they had friends abroad, but from what D. Bernardo
said to Girolamo it is thought that Neri Acciaiuoli was agreed with
Count Girolamo, but did not confide in others. Here, however, they
pretend not to believe this; but suspect it the more because so many
of their enemies have left for Rome.... Your Excellency must know that
these men ought <i>de jure</i> not to have been hung, for as they
committed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</span> no overt act they did not deserve death. So the Signoria,
together with the Seventy, determined that it was <i>crimen lesæ
maiestatis</i>, alleging that they had tried to curtail liberty and
change the government which depended upon Lorenzo; so it was declared
that whoever attacked Lorenzo commits <i>crimen lesæ maiestatis</i>,
thus giving to him great honour. Some say this will rather injure than
benefit him, because the more he is elevated above others the more
enemies he will have.... June 9, 1481.<a id="FNanchor_293" href="#Footnote_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a></p>

to-day befallen me through the death of my most beloved mother Madonna
Lucrezia. This leaves me utterly desolate as Your Excellency can
think, for I have lost, not only a mother, but the only person I
could turn to in many vexations and who aided me in many troubles.
It is true that we ought to submit patiently to the will of God, but
in this case my heart refuses to be comforted. I pray He may perhaps
send me patience and comfort, and grant her peace and happiness. Your

<p>The peace of November 1480 did not last long. Sixtus IV., entirely
under the influence of his nephew Girolamo Riario, had deposed
Antonello Ordelaffi in order to give Forli to Riario, who was known
also to covet Faenza. This was a direct menace to Florence whose road
to the Adriatic would have been cut off. Ferrara likewise attracted
him; he visited Venice, where he was received like a king and made a
patrician of the Republic, to plan an attack on Duke Ercole. Venice
was to take the Duchy of Modena, which belonged to the Duke, while
Riario added Ferrara to his other possessions. A pretext was easily
found. The Venetians claimed the sole right of supplying salt to North
Italy from Cervia and summoned the Duke to cease collecting it at
Comacchio. He refused and war was declared in May 1482. Preparations
for resisting Riario and Venice, and defending Ferrara, were pushed
forward in feverish haste, as is shown by the letter from the Duke
of Urbino to Lorenzo, while those from Ugolino Baccio relate to that
simple-minded, scatter-brained Slav, Andrea Zuccalmaglio, a Dominican
Archbishop of Krain. Sent to Rome in 1479 as ambassador by the Emperor
Frederick III. he was intensely shocked by what he saw and did not
hide his feelings. The Pope showed his displeasure and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</span> Archbishop
was recalled. Before he could leave Rome he was imprisoned in Castel
S. Angelo, and on his release went to Basel determined to proclaim a
Council. He assumed the titles of Cardinal and Papal Legate, and made
a clever notary of Trier, Peter Numagen, his secretary, who in his
<i>Gesta Archiepiscopi Crayneris</i> describes his master as touched
in the brain. On March 25th he denounced Sixtus IV. during service in
the cathedral and solemnly proclaimed a Council. On July 20th he cited
the Pope thus: “Francesco of Savona, son of the devil, you entered
your Office not through the door, but through the window of simony.
You are of your father the devil and labour to do your father’s will.”
Sixtus excommunicated him and laid Basel under an interdict, of which
no notice was taken. He was both angry and alarmed as he suspected the
Emperor of secretly abetting the Archbishop, while Milan and Florence
sent envoys to see how matters stood. The Florentine evidently at
first sided hotly with the Archbishop, and believed in the possibility
of a reforming Council. But Lorenzo was cautious. He left Baccio’s
letters unanswered, to the poor man’s discomfiture. The Archbishop was
disavowed by the Emperor, and the magistrates refusing to give him up
to the papal Legate he was imprisoned in Basel, and hanged himself in
his cell in November 1484.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Magnifice frater carissime</i>,—By the copy of a letter I have
written to the Illustrious Duke of Ferrara which I send to the
Honourable Eight of the Balìa, Your Magnificence will see that I have
had news of the loss of the fortress of Melara. The enemy evidently
means to join that force with their navy and to follow the course of
the river to attack Ferrara. There is no doubt that if the Illustrious
League does not instantly provide reinforcements in that quarter they
may succeed in their attempt, because that Illustrious Lord is not
strong enough to resist without help as Your Magnificence knows.</p>

<p>In this state of imminent peril it is imperative that the Honourable
Signoria of Florence should send me in all haste as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</span> many men-at-arms
as possible, particularly from Romagna and Valle de Lamone, who are
nearer, and being better trained men are more useful than any others.
As soon as the Illustrious Duke of Milan sends me the foot and horse I
have asked for, I shall advance into the Ferrara territory to keep the
enemy in check. If the Illustrious League provide what, for their own
honour and advantage, is necessary to enable me to confront the enemy
I shall not be found wanting, but there is a great difference between
projecting a thing and carrying it through. I do not enlarge on this
as I know Your Magnificence will understand how important it is, and
<i>cum omne diligentia</i> will give the requisite orders.</p>

<p>I remind Your Magnificence about hastening to despatch the troops we
arranged were to come into the State of the Signor Constanzio [Sforza]
and into Urbino. This is pressing as I have summoned my men to join
me here, but until those troops arrive they cannot move as our lands
cannot be left defenceless.</p>

<p>My opinion is that the said Signor Constanzio should advance into
Tuscany and take up a position between Arezzo and Anghiara, which
will not only protect the State of the Honourable Signoria of
Florence, but my own and that of Signor Constanzio and perhaps, if
fortune favours us, be a means of offending the enemy. It would be
a good move and I beg Your Magnificence to send orders from there
without losing a moment. I have already given this same advice to His
Excellency.—Rovere, May 4, 1482.<a id="FNanchor_296" href="#Footnote_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ugolino Baccio</span>, <i>from Basel, to</i> <span class="smcap">Lorenzo de’
Medici</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Magnifice vir</i>, &amp;c.,—I arrived here on the 14th, and by the
aid of a citizen here, called Giovanni Hermin, very friendly to your
house, was introduced to Craina.<a id="FNanchor_297" href="#Footnote_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a> I offered him your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</span> help in his
undertaking, praising him and alluring him <i>ut moris est</i>. After
exchanging many sweet speeches (<i>chiaverini</i>) we came at last
to essential matters, to which, although he enlarged <i>et vultu et
verbis</i> as much as he could, I do not attach more faith than is
necessary unless he adduces better evidence. He shows nothing from the
Emperor [Frederick III.], which proves there is no great eagerness
in that quarter. He talks much about France and other countries,
particularly about Savoy, but I believe what I see; there are many
ruffians to be found, but I am a cut-throat.</p>

<p>Who does please me is the chief personage. In capacity, talent, and
doctrine, he seems to be fit for any great enterprise, <i>et quod
magis me movet</i> has great knowledge and experience of the world,
for many, many years he has been employed in grave affairs and
honourable legations.</p>

<p><i>Accedit</i> he is a friar, which is the summit, or the adornment,
of all his other qualities, and he has so confident and fearless an
air that he would make a man dance a gagliarda<a id="FNanchor_298" href="#Footnote_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a> against his will,
whoever he might be.</p>

<p>Secondly the town chosen pleases me. It is convenient, handsome,
healthy, and there is ample accommodation for congresses, vehicles,
and ships.</p>

<p>Thirdly the citizens are most well-disposed, which pleases me most
of all. I have proof of this because they will not permit their
priests to observe the interdict and support the Archbishop <i>quantum
possunt</i>. Yesterday they despatched their Chancellor to the Emperor
to complain of the Pope <i>propter interdictum</i>, and to remind him
not to allow the Council to depart, as if it is not held in Basel it
will be transferred elsewhere to his loss and shame, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Another of their ambassadors went to the Emperor a month ago and a
courier later with letters. There is as yet no news of either, but
they expect an answer from day to day. The Milanese envoy and I are
idly waiting and do not know what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</span> to do with ourselves. We came here
as private persons without any show and have not kept our attendants
with us, in order not to spend much money in case nothing comes of
this business, and so we shall remain for the present.</p>

<p>If a favourable answer comes we shall present ourselves officially
to the Commune. Perhaps I shall do so before, without the Milanese,
as a guarantee to our persons <i>in omnem eventum</i>; particularly
as they know through Craina that I am here for this affair, and it
might rather cause suspicion and give them a bad opinion of me if I
do not announce myself openly and show that I am informed of what is
going on. But I have not yet made up my mind and shall follow God’s
inspiration.</p>

<p>If, owing to the Emperor, the Council is not held here, we have talked
of transferring it to Pisa or elsewhere in Italy. His Paternity does
not think the idea a bad one. Consider about this and let me know.
Pisa would be convenient to the Spaniards and to many other kingdoms,
who perhaps would serve our purpose better than Germany. His Paternity
is ready to do anything to upset the Pope and the Count [Girolamo
Riario]. I have said enough.</p>

<p>I do not write at any length so that you may not be bored. If
you desire to know more, ask the Eight to show you what I have
written to them with far more details. I commend myself to Your
Magnificence.—Basel, September 20, 1482.<a id="FNanchor_299" href="#Footnote_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Magnificent Lorenzo</span>,—By the Milanese courier who left
this on the 20th I wrote very fully to the Eight and also to Your
Magnificence, of what had occurred.</p>

<p>Since then nothing of any importance has happened; things seem more
favourable than otherwise. The adverse Legates<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</span> have made no sign,
they are still in a Swiss town called Torego, <i>alias</i> Suringg,
a long day’s journey from here. We suppose they do not like to risk
coming here on account of the anger excited by the interdict, and that
they are feeling their way how to approach without danger. This is
the opinion of the Council. Perhaps they have other designs and are
waiting in order to give us a heavier blow. Who knows their secrets?
We have no fear of them, if they have of us; but this is uncertain.
The fact is they have not come, and as things are they would only
arrive here in pieces.</p>

<p>The citizens are strongly in favour of the Council, and unless forced
by the Emperor I do not think they will let it drop, particularly as
it brings them great gain and honour.</p>

<p>The ambassador sent to Duke Sigismondo has returned bringing, they
say, a most favourable reply. I know no particulars as yet, for these
people are much more taciturn than we are, and very strict observers
of public honour. Unfortunately that friend of the house of Medici has
been sent on an embassy, so it is hard fishing for secrets. <i>Tamen
si quid erit, haud diu nos latere potest.</i></p>

<p>No reply has yet come from the Emperor. But as the road is long and
there is war in the countries the messenger must traverse this is not
to be wondered at. An answer is expected every day, so it seems to
me that <i>pendeant leges et Prophetæ</i>. Other help appears to me
vain. We will see what God sends, and I shall inform you of all <i>cum
diligentia</i>. I have suggested Pisa to Monsignore several times in
case Basel fails us, but at present he hopes in Cæsar. Think well
about this so that (<i>quod Dii prohibeant</i>) we are not left with
our feet out of both stirrups.</p>

<p>Monsignore has told the people here that we have come in favour of
their cause, and as on account of the delay of these envoys I feared
they might draw back seeing Monsignore unsupported, I informed the
town council that I was sent officially by our Signoria, presented the
letters, &amp;c., and made<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</span> a long oration <i>in favorem Consilii</i>,
praising the holy enterprise and Craina, and condemning the Sixtine
government, and showing the necessity for a Council; all which they
heard with great pleasure, particularly as I offered not only help and
favour, and embassies and prelates from the Florentines, but promised
to confirm this in their name and in that of the League.</p>

<p>I am sure that in their <i>perplexione propter venturos Legato
Pontificiis</i> this has comforted their minds, <i>juxta Terentianum
illud, dum in dubis est animus</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>They promised to reply <i>post consultationem</i>. <i>Sic res se
habent nunc.</i> To-day I await them in my house and shall hear their
answer.</p>

<p><i>Post scripta.</i>—Four of the members have just been here and in
the name of the Senate praised my speech, and thank the Florentines
for their offers which they reciprocate.</p>

<p>As to the Council they declare that they are well-disposed towards
the Apostolic See if the Church is reformed <i>pro Religione et fide
Christi, quam vident in magno periculo vel potius ruina</i>. They
also affirm that they initiated nothing, but only acted according to
the wishes of the Emperor, from whom an explicit answer is expected
in a few days. When it arrives they will tell me at once so that I
can write to my Signoria who can then send prelates and ambassadors
as I have promised. For this I thanked them with opportune words. I
see that I am everything in their eyes, besides which Craina depends
entirely on me and has not been happy since he entered into this
business until I spoke officially. He will not let me out of his
sight, either to go to the Emperor or elsewhere. A thousand times a
day he raises his hands to heaven thanking God for sending me to him.
You have no idea how intently these Doctors of the University read
the documents I have published. What can I say more? The Pope is more
hated here than he is with us, and if the Emperor does not spoil our
game <i>non sum sine spe</i> to arrive at something.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</span></p>

<p>This is all I write to-day as I send this by a man who is passing
through in haste. Will Your Magnificence be good enough to make my
excuses to the Eight? Your letter was begun and there is no time to
write another. This must serve also for their Excellencies. I commend

nothing has occurred since to alter my opinion about the Council,

<p>Although Craina hopes for success here he is feeling his way
elsewhere; if he fails here and can extricate himself he will throw
himself into the arms of him who promises most. Till now I have only
been able to give assurances of my personal aid, promising him support
and favour from the League in order to pacify him. But how do I know
what will be my fate? Perchance the League will have nought to do with
the Council save at Basel, or has some other plan of which I know<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</span>
nothing. So that although I have a general mandate to do all I can
to help forward the Council, which I, although you do not write, am
doing, yet I do wish for your own particular views, otherwise I grope
in darkness.</p>

<p>However now we are here making every effort that things should go
forward, and though we found the foundations rather weak we have so
propped the house that we do not fear it will fall at every small
stroke. But if, through the Emperor or the Swiss, Basel was shut to
us, I do not see why the League after such a beginning should abandon
the enterprise. I gave the reasons in other letters, but the decision
lies with others who perhaps are of a contrary opinion.</p>

<p>I have written a detailed account of what happens to the Eight. My own
impressions, such as they are, I write to Your Magnificence, to whom I
can explain things with more freedom than to such eminent magistrates.
You can therefore guess at the truth; to me it appears that although
there is danger there is also hope.</p>

<p><i>Exitus in Diis est: tamen</i> if a month after our arrival here
a bishop had declared for us things would not be so backward or so
ill looked on as they are; even if one was now on the way here so
as not to delay giving medicine to the corpse! <i>At inquies.</i>
Either the Emperor has not manifested his approval, what then? or
he has not openly turned against the enterprise. For my designs it
would be sufficient to stay here long enough for things to make a
little progress, and then I would gladly pay ready money for a valid
impediment in order to transfer all to a more convenient spot. I pray
Your Magnificence to take the follies I have written for what they are
worth and to judge and command according to your own wishes. <i>Ego
jussa exequar</i> and to that I commend myself.—Basel, October 25,
1482.<a id="FNanchor_301" href="#Footnote_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a></p>

<p>Sixtus IV. had been thoroughly frightened by the threatened Council at
Basel and had also fallen under the influence of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</span> nephew Cardinal
Giuliano della Rovere, who feared the growing power of Venice and
was friendly to the Medici. In December 1482 he hurriedly made peace
with Naples and Ferrara, and received the Duke of Calabria in the
Vatican. Alfonso then started for Ferrara, passing through Florence
early in January, where he stayed three days in the house of Giovanni
Tornabuoni. Venice refused to obey the Pope’s commands to make peace
with Ferrara, and the city was in dire straits. It was only the
encouragement and advice of Bongianni Gianfigliazzi, the Florentine
ambassador, that prevented Duke Ercole from quitting Ferrara and
taking refuge at Modena. A Congress of the Allies was summoned at
Cremona, to which Lorenzo went early in February 1483, in spite of
strong opposition from his fellow-citizens, who feared he might be
assassinated by his arch-enemy Girolamo Riario. Louis XI. shared these
fears as is seen in his letter. The Congress at Cremona consisted of
the Cardinal Legate Gonzaga, Alfonso Duke Of Calabria, Lodovico and
Ascanio Sforza, Ercole d’Este Duke of Ferrara, Federigo Gonzaga Marquis
of Mantua, Giovanni Bentovoglio of Bologna, Girolamo Riario,<a id="FNanchor_302" href="#Footnote_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a>

<p>The following tale and poem in Latin (which I have done into prose)
were sent to Lorenzo by Bartolommeo Scala,<a id="FNanchor_305" href="#Footnote_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a> who prided himself on
his literary conceits and on his pure Latinity. I insert them as they
are typical of the conceits of the fifteenth century.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">My Patron</span>, greeting,—Last September when I was at Morba,
where you now are, for my gout, I composed a conceit on the nymph
Amorba, childish enough perhaps. If you have time to read this it
may not displease you. Trifles of this kind sometimes give pleasure.
Indeed those who have been with you inform me that you have sought
anew the society of the Muses and are their constant boon companion.
Of a truth they can heal our diseases much more pleasantly than any
baths.</p>

<p>This indeed is attested with perhaps a certain neatness by an apologue
of mine. It is as follows.</p>

<p>Once upon a time Immortality and Old Age were quarrelling. The cause
was small, the quarrel was and still is a grievous one. Immortality
had reared from the nest a tame jackdaw, cunning, thievish, clever,
with a power of imitating our language not unmusically. She had kept
it in luxury for ninety years. The neighbours actually approved of
it in their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</span> enjoyment of the constant jesting and laughter which it
caused. For it used secretly to steal from the tailor’s workboxes
rings and needles and other implements, and then, when the fancy
seized it, all of a sudden gave them back. How the onlookers used
to laugh and applaud when it brought a modest blush to a maiden’s
cheek as she walked along the road by calling with a gentle chuckle Ω
χόρη καλη<a id="FNanchor_306" href="#Footnote_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a> (it had learnt Greek as well as Latin) Ἡλίου ὡς ὁμοιῷ
φωτί.<a id="FNanchor_307" href="#Footnote_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a> But Old Age was envious and sent disease, her frequent
minister, and killed the jackdaw. So was war kindled. Then when
Old Age had taken many towns, and sacked many cities, she forced
Immortality at length to take refuge in her citadel.</p>

<p>Her citadel stands on a high mountain. Its walls and battlements are
of brass, but the rooms of its inner chambers of sweetest-smelling
cedarwood. The enemy is held at bay (and this no one who did not know
would easily believe) by maidens alone, by three maidens with their
songs and verses. Now, could you but extract the harmonies of these
maidens from the letters in which they are written and manage to apply
them to your bare breast and heart, there is nothing so health-giving
against all diseases of body and mind. I commend myself to you.
Farewell.—Florence, April 15, 1484.</p>

<p>Thou askest who I am, what is my name, and whence comes this hot and
health-giving water that springs perennial? Once I was the loveliest
nymph of these woods. Apollo loved me and gave me the power of curing
all ills. Fleeter of foot<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</span> than the stag or the roe, I was the most
renowned and the most welcome of the Oread sisters or the Dryads. But
we have long known how cruel and potent is fate, and how unstable are
all things here below. When wandering one day, bow in hand, my quiver
on my shoulder, O unhappy nymph! Cerberus saw me and was inflamed with
brutal lust. Of no avail were my bow, my arrows, or my swift feet.
Furiously he pursued me and deaf to my prayers and tears he seized
me, O unhappy one. In vain I screamed and struggled, and called upon
all the Gods of heaven. Almost vanquished I cried out, imploring aid:
“O you sylvan nymphs, have mercy, hasten to save me.” The goddesses
heard, changed me into a hot stream and thus delivered me from those
ferocious hands. As a spring I still preserve the power bestowed by
Apollo of curing all ills. Phœbus pitied and wept over my fate, and
swore by the Styx to undo thee, O Cerberus. A huge stone, high as a
mountain, surrounded by precipices and broken rocks, was torn asunder
and a yawning and dark cave opened, whence issued a horrid wind
charged with fetid odours. Inside all was putrid, in festering matter
lay the entrails and bones of oxen which he bore while yet alive into
the cave to satiate his rabid hunger. Whilst intent on devouring the
raw flesh and sucking the stream of hot blood, the highborn Archer
wounded him. His torn and bleeding entrails gushed forth. But as he
could change his form at will, Cerberus became a dog. From three
throats came despairing howls and the vapour of burning sulphur when
Apollo hurled him down from the rock into deepest hell, where it is
rumoured that he still retains the semblance of a dog. There, where
the brute sank, remain signs of hell, and they say that sinners are
there drawn down to well-deserved punishment. All around are lakes
of deep mud; mud and sulphur are belched up, and from afar one still
hears the ever-renewed howling of dogs. The rock preserved the name
and the mountain whence it fell is called Cerberus. But I remain
unknown, no kind Muse remembered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</span> me and I waited for one to tell of
my woes. Lo he comes, and here he writes a poem for me. Read it, O
pilgrim; then thou wilt know that Amorba is the name of the nymph. The
waters will drive away all illness, let the sick come here and they
will find health.<a id="FNanchor_309" href="#Footnote_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a></p>

<p>Lorenzo’s great enemy Sixtus IV. died on August 12, 1484, killed, say
contemporaries, by a violent fit of anger at the proclamation of the
peace of Bagnolo. The Cardinals entered into Conclave on August 26th,
and three days later Giovanni Battista Cibò, born at Genoa in 1432, was
elected Pope under the name of Innocent VIII.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Guidantonio Vespucci</span>, <i>Florentine Ambassador at Rome, to</i>
<span class="smcap">Lorenzo de’ Medici</span> <i>at Florence</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Magnifice vir</i>,—If my letter about the election of the Pope
[Innocent VIII.] was delayed, the fault lies with Antonio Tornabuoni
who sent off the courier without waiting for me. I was at Mass
with the other ambassadors and could not leave before them. The
Milanese courier was despatched by Francesco da Casale and not by the
ambassador. I beg you to excuse me.</p>

<p>Of the new Pope I will tell you all I have heard. As Cardinal he
passed for a kindly and benign man, and was most courteous to all,
kissing any and all even more than one you know of. His political
experience is small and he is not learned, though not ignorant. He
was always devoted to S. Pietro in Vincula [Giuliano della Rovere,
afterwards Julius II.] and indeed was made a cardinal by his
influence. He is tall, full in the face, about fifty-five years of
age, and very robust. He has a brother, at least one grown-up bastard
son and some daughters, who are married here. As cardinal he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</span> did not
agree well with the Count [Girolamo Riario, nephew of the late Pope].
S. Pietro in Vincula is now as good as Pope and will have more power
than under Sixtus if he knows how to steer. The Pope has a Genoese
friar who is said to have a mistress of the house of Cibò, Guelph of
course. Here he has a nephew, a priest, related to Filippo di Nerone,
whose mistress is a certain Maria Clemenza—she was wife to Stoldo
Altoviti. The late Captain of infantry is married to a relation of
his. The Pope seems rather a man in need of advice than one capable of
giving it to others.</p>

<p>The election took place thus. The Rev. Monsignori of Aragona and
Visconti seeing that they could not effect the election of the
Vice-Chancellor and that he stood on the defence, tried to persuade
him to play their game, and <i>ante omnia</i> reconciled the
Camarlingo and Ursino with S. Pietro in Vincula, towards whom they
were beginning to be friendly, and I think they promised to arrange
the affairs of the Count and of the Camarlingo. Many other promises
were made. First, to the Cardinal of Aragona the Pope gives his
own house; to Messer di Visconti the house belonging to the Count,
which the Pope will pay for, besides 12,000 ducats, the legation of
the Patrimony, and I know not what besides at Castello; to Savello
the legation of Bologna; to Milan that of Avignon; all of which
latter legations were held by S. Pietro in Vincula who consented
to everything in order to carry this business through, he has also
renounced certain abbeys to satisfy others whose names I know not.
Colonna will no doubt also be recompensed, and the Vice-Chancellor has
obtained certain things he wanted in Spain. Noara has had I know what
castle. Of others I have not heard. No doubt there are many similar
cases.</p>

<p>To conclude, this election is attributed entirely to Monsignore di
Visconti and I think you ought to write to him that he should help us
when I have need of aid in your affairs. Also send a proper letter to
S. Pietro in Vincula for he is the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</span> only one I have any fear of in the
business of Fonte Dolce,<a id="FNanchor_310" href="#Footnote_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a> he is the Pope, <i>et plusquam Papa</i>.
Believe me that Monsignori Aragona and Visconti will plunder this
court at every election, they are the two biggest scoundrels in the
world.</p>

<p>In a few days I shall begin to adjust your affairs and shall succeed,
as in the beginning these princes and popes are usually very gracious,
and His Holiness is well disposed towards you and has always been very
friendly to me. Remember before the new Signori are named to have my
leave arranged as I want to be at home during September, and I hope
you will grant my desire that my Simone should be made one of the
Eight.—Roma, August 29, 1484. Remember also to push on the enterprise
of Sarzana, afterwards there might be danger.<a id="FNanchor_311" href="#Footnote_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a></p>

<p>According to custom the Republic of Florence sent an embassy to
congratulate Innocent VIII. on his nomination. With them went Lorenzo’s
eldest son, Piero, then fourteen years of age, to whom his father wrote
the following letter containing minute instructions as to his speech
and conduct. From Lorenzo’s remark, “Though thou art my son, thou art
but a citizen of Florence,” and his impressing upon him to be polite
and not to take precedence of his elders, one sees he was already
anxious about the boy’s overbearing, turbulent temper.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Lorenzo de’ Medici</span> <i>to his son</i> <span class="smcap">Piero</span> <i>in
Rome, November 26, 1484</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Thou wilt have only four letters of introduction for Siena, one to
Messer Paulo di Gherardo, one to Messer Cristofano di Guido, and
one to Messer Andrea Piccolomini, whom thou art to visit at their
houses and there deliver the letters to them.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</span> Commend me to Their
Magnificences, using the same words to all, thus: that passing through
Siena on thy way to Rome with these ambassadors I charged thee to
visit Their Magnificences whom I love and revere as fathers; that I
hope they will regard thee as a son, command thee at any time or in
any place, as I do, and that thou wilt obey them; and that as they
can dispose of my property, State, and children, of whom thou art
one, thou presentest thyself to them as being theirs to dispose of
according to their pleasure. Use proper words to this effect without
affectation or constraint, and do not try to appear learned with them
or with others, but speak graciously, pleasantly, and seriously.</p>

<p>Thou wilt have a list of Sienese citizens to whom, if there is time,
thou art to pay visits, using the same words I have already indicated
and offering me to them, as well as to the three above-named, for the
protection of their State, all the more that our city is of this mind.</p>

<p>When together with other youths of the ambassadors bear thyself
sedately, politely, and kindly, towards thy equals. Be careful not to
take precedence of those who are thine elders, for although thou art
my son, thou art but a citizen of Florence, as they are. When Giovanni
[Tornabuoni] thinks fit to present thee to the Pope privately first
inform thyself well of all the needful ceremonies, then when presented
to His Sanctity kiss my letter which will be given thee for the Pope,
entreating him to deign to read it. When it is thy turn to speak,
first place me at the feet of His Beatitude, saying that I am aware it
was my duty to prostrate myself in person at the feet of His Holiness,
as I did at those of his Predecessor of saintly memory; but that I
trust in his goodness to forgive me, because at that time I had my
brother who was well able to fill my place, whereas at present I have
no man of greater years and authority than thyself, and therefore I do
not think it would have been pleasing to His Holiness if I had left
Florence. Say that I send thee in my stead as the strongest proof I
could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</span> give of my desire to go in person. Besides other reasons also
I have sent thee in order that thou shouldst learn early to regard
His Beatitude as thy Father and Lord, and be encouraged to continue
in this devotion, in which I educate my other children, whom I would
rather not have if they were not so inclined. Then thou wilt inform
His Holiness that I am firmly resolved not to transgress his commands,
because, besides my natural devotion to the Holy See, my devotion to
His Beatitude himself arises from many causes and from obligations
which ever since I was <i>in minoribus</i> our house has received
from him. Add that I have experienced how hurtful it has been to be
out of favour with the late Pontiff although, as it seems to me, I
was unjustly persecuted rather for others’ sins than for any insult
or offence to him of holy memory. But I leave this to the judgment of
others. Be it as it may I am firmly determined, not only not to offend
His Beatitude in any way, but to think day and night on what I can
do to please him; thus I trust that the joy and pleasure which the
nomination of His Beatitude to the Pontificate caused me will endure
for long, and I supplicate His Beatitude to accept me and my children
and all that is mine as his humble sons and servants, and to preserve
to us his grace, inasmuch as we shall make every effort to deserve his
goodwill.</p>

<p>After this thou art to say to His Holiness that having thus
recommended me, brotherly love constrains thee to recommend also
Messer Giovanni, whom I have brought up as a priest, and endeavour to
educate morally and intellectually in such a way that he should not
be put to shame among others. All my hope in this matter is in His
Beatitude who has already, out of his clemency and humanity, shown
him some affection, and as we are in his good graces I entreat him
to continue his benevolence, and to add to the other obligations our
house has towards the Holy See by favouring this affair of Messer
Giovanni; strive with these and other words to recommend thy brother.
I have now said enough about the Pope. Thou wilt have my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</span> letters
to all the cardinals which thou wilt deliver or not according to
Giovanni’s directions. Commend me to them and say thou art come to
Rome to express my devotion to Their Most Reverend Lords, and also in
order that they may make acquaintance with him who will continue the
devotion of our house towards them, and that they are to command thee
and make use of thee as of all that is mine, offering thyself, &amp;c.
This thou wilt say to all in general, but to those on the marked list
thou wilt say as follows.</p>

<p>To Cardinal Visconti say that even were he not a Cardinal, our house
has old and innate obligations to all his illustrious house, and that
as my son and by nature an ally of the Sforzas (Sforzesco), and a
devoted servant of His Most Reverend Lordship thou beseechest him to
command thee, and to treat thee as one of his house and accept thee as
his servant, as are all of our house.</p>

<p>To Cardinal d’Aragona say that as I place all my hopes and trust in
H.M. the King his father, it is thy duty as my son to present thyself
to His Most Reverend Lordship, and that thou and my other sons,
besides the many benefits received from H.M. the King, can never
forget the honours paid to me at Naples and the mode of sending me
home, and that thou art well aware what would have been thy condition
and that of my other children, if things had gone differently. For
this reason His Most Reverend Lordship and all the other sons of
H.M. the King may sell thee, or pawn thee, and treat thee as a thing
belonging to them.</p>

<p>To Cardinal Orsini say that I have sent thee to Rome for him to see
how offshoots of their tree prosper in our soil and what fruit they
bear, and that, such as they are, I send the first-fruit to His Most
Reverend Lordship, and that although an unworthy son of the house
of Orsini thou desirest, such as thou art, to be a servant of His
Reverence, to whom as head of the house thou art willing and ready,
during thy whole life as far thou canst, to repay the obligations thou
art under to his noble<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</span> house, which are indeed great, as thou owest
thy being to it. For this reason thou art come to beg him as head,
&amp;c., to take thee under his care and to instruct thee, for thy honour
and success will reflect upon him as much as upon me, thy father;
commend to him Clarice and thy brothers and sisters, &amp;c.</p>

<p>To the cardinals who are related to the Orsini, as I think are the
Savelli, Conti, and Colonna, thou wilt make use of more familiar
language than to the others, saying that besides other obligations
I have towards them, we are, by the grace of God, related to their
noble families, which I consider as one of the chief ornaments of
our house. To Monsignore our Archbishop of Florence thou art to show
all these instructions before making any visits, which on account of
thine age may be very short ones. I hope that His Lordship, being
better informed and more prudent, will add anything needful, assuring
him that what I say is not merely formal but the truth, and do either
more or less than his Lordship directs, as though it was I who told
thee. At all events thou art to visit all the Orsini who are in Rome,
speaking with due reverence, commending me to Their Lordships and
offering thyself as their son and servant, they having deigned to
become our relations by which thou art the chief gainer as being of
higher birth, and therefore it is but right thou shouldst strive to
repay them. I send thee with Giovanni Tornabuoni, whom thou art to
obey in all things and not to presume to do aught without him. Be
modest and kindly in manner towards him and every one, and strive to
bear thyself with sedateness, all the more that sedateness is not a
youthful virtue. The honours and flatteries that will be bestowed upon
thee will be a great danger if thou art not discreet and rememberest
who thou art. If Gugliemo [de’ Pazzi] or his sons or grandsons come
to see thee receive them kindly, but quietly, showing sorrow for
their condition and encouraging them to act well and to hope for
better things by so doing. Should Monsignore our Archbishop think it
right for thee to go to any place outside Rome to visit any of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</span>
Orsini, thou canst do so; obey His Lordship in this and in everything,
as I have already said, as thou wouldst obey me. Tell Gugliemo that
Bianca<a id="FNanchor_312" href="#Footnote_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a> having written in my name, and in that of Bernardo
Rucellai, to ask him to give up the Canonry of Pisa to her for a
certain exchange she wishes to make, he ought to do it, particularly
as Bernardo offers to serve him and to help him in whatever way he
thinks best. Impress this upon him.</p>

<p><i>Salve, o alter ego.</i></p>

<p>Good-bye Ser Piero, good-bye Franco, good-bye Lorenzo, Butti,
Franceschi, good-bye, good-bye, &amp;c. We parted at Capitulo near Bagno
a Morba. Florence having quitted Pisa,<a id="FNanchor_315" href="#Footnote_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a> we came gaily singing
and joking to the mill on this side of Monte Castelli, where we
found twenty-five soldiers with shields and spears whom we had seen
from above, when we said to one another, “Who are those fellows down
there?” and we all shouted “<i>Palle, Palle</i>”; they replied,
“<i>Palle, Palle e Orso, Orso</i>,” and as we came nearer the shouts
of <i>Palle</i> and <i>Orso</i> redoubled. We then saw they were men
sent from Monte Castelli to escort us, &amp;c. They wanted us to enter the
townlet, but we declined, so they came with us down into the plain
where was a crowd of women with faces as wrinkled as chestnut cakes,
but all very merry and happy with tables spread out with wine, puff
pastry, &amp;c. We drank in haste, and keeping one of the soldiers as
a guide discharged the others, and went on our journey singing and
chatting gaily. Passing by deserted Monte Guidi, half-way down the
hill we met a priest with his frock tucked up and so out of breath he
might have come from Assisi, who said he was a friend of Donnino,<a id="FNanchor_316" href="#Footnote_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a>
and implored us to dismount at his church and house, he was so
exhausted and ran up and down so incessantly, that if he did not go
and be bled I fear that by this time he is no more. God help him. We
left, or rather we did not stop, and passed down below Casoli without
entering, and about four miles this side of the village Martino Ghezo
and Martino Moro caught us up, not having been able to keep<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</span> up with
us as we rode fast. They told us that on the other side of Casoli they
met the so-much-longed-for Nannina<a id="FNanchor_317" href="#Footnote_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a> in a carriage, and that she
asked about Lorenzo and Madonna Clarice. Hearing that Madonna Clarice
had passed, and that Lorenzo had gone to Pisa, she was, they said, in
despair, and showed great sorrow at not having seen Lorenzo, or even
having been able to talk to Madonna Clarice. When Madonna heard this
she several times lamented the bad luck of their missing each other,
&amp;c.</p>

<p>And thus, till about two miles from Colle di Val d’Elsa, we continued
singing, joking, and talking. Then we became almost dumb, for nearly
all our words migrated into a brother of Antonio del Pela who came
to meet us, and conducted us into the tumbledown and ruined village
of Colle to the house of the said Antonio. He came forward with such
a river and flood of words that he drowned his brother, and us, and
all who were near, and showed that he was truly the elder and the
better brother. On entering the hall we found about thirty-five
members of his family—girls, women, and children. My bore immediately
began: “Madonna Clarice, this is my daughter, come forward, kiss the
lady’s hand; and this is my granddaughter, come forward, touch her
gown. And this one, and this one. And these little ones are all my
grandchildren; hold yourselves up, think of your manners; this one is
to be a priest, this one a nun, to this one Madonna Lucrezia stood
godmother, this one I have just given in marriage, this one makes
Venetian fringe, that one lace.” Plague take him. If I had not pulled
him away he would have cast a spell on us all. But by asserting how
tired Madonna Clarice and we all were I managed to damp his ardour.
We arrived about twenty-two or twenty-three of the clock, and after
resting we went to see paper made,<a id="FNanchor_318" href="#Footnote_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a> and returned to fetch Madonna
Clarice, who thought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</span> it a pretty thing, and was much interested in
the machines, the water, the air, &amp;c. Then we went back and supped
about one of the clock: a few wafers, cakes, and trebbiano,<a id="FNanchor_319" href="#Footnote_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a> salad
and pickles, boiled fowl, and kid: and then young pigeons roasted, and
I know not what preparation of fowl, marzipan, sweets, and comfits, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Before supper the Commune of Colle made an offering to Madonna of
corn, marzipan, wine, sweetmeats, &amp;c., presented by eloquent orators,
three out of the number. The substance was that as Lorenzo, whom
they had expected, had not come, they presented all to her as being
a second Lorenzo, with many excuses for the smallness of the gift
owing to their poverty, and begged her to commend them and the town to
Lorenzo. Madonna, by God, replied well and briefly, saying that they
were not friends as they declared, for had they been they would have
known that Lorenzo and herself would protect them without expecting
gifts, which were rather things pertaining to strangers than to good
friends. “On the one hand, you complain and ask me to represent to
Lorenzo the poverty and the needs of yourselves and of your town, and
then you spend money in these things. I take the will for the deed and
give all back to you; for if I kept them I should only give them to
the town for the love of God, so I bestow them on you who are poorer
than I.” There was a great ado because they steadfastly refused to
take the things away, alleging that there were plots against them,
&amp;c. Ser Giovanni Antonio and I sent them back by some of our people,
keeping four flasks of wine and some marzipan to content them, and to
show we wished them well.</p>

<p>We slept right well, and though Pela broke our heads with his idle
chatter, I must say he received us with great courtesy and affection:
and, after all, a good heart is to be admired more than other things.</p>

<p>In the evening after supper there appeared a certain Messer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</span> Ricco,
an envoy from Siena, who remained with Madonna Clarice and Messer
Giovanni Antonio for half-an-hour, talking about the rising at Siena.
He said that Lorenzo had written that he was leaving Bagno with his
wife, but did not say where he was going, so he thought to find him
here. I know Ser Giovanni Antonio was satisfied with the report given
by the envoy so I say no more.</p>

<p>Before leaving in the morning Messer Giovanni Antonio and I paid a
visit to the Podestà. Then with a guide we came to Tavernelle and then
to Pasignano, where Donnino had preceded us; we reached there about
fifteen of the clock. After resting awhile we dined: liver and lights,
boiled kid, broad beans, curds and good wine, and then we visited
the whole house, the church, and the relics. Madonna Clarice was
more pleased than I can say with the house and with her room. There
we stayed all day seeing different things. Our supper was salad, an
excellent herb pie, fried curds, broad beans and cheese, &amp;c.</p>

<p>In the morning, that is yesterday morning, we left directly after
mass, coming by the S. Casciano road. Just under Fabrica a man
galloped up, saying: “Your Piero sends me to find out by which road
you are coming, for yester evening he came out several miles to meet
you, and has now gone with Messer Giovanni and all the others towards
S. Maria Impruneta.” We replied that we were bound to S. Casciano. He
flew off to bear the message, and at last on this side of S. Casciano,
as we were crossing the river, we met Jacopo Salviati and his friend
Tommasino de’ Corbinelli, who greeted us with great joy, and rode back
with us. Then near the Certosa we met paradise full of festive and
joyous angels, that is to say, Messer Giovanni and Piero, and Giuliano
and Giulio on pillions, with all their attendants. As soon as they saw
their mother they threw themselves from their horses, some without
help, others aided by their people, and they ran forward and were
lifted into the arms of Madonna Clarice, with such joy and kisses and
delight<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</span> that a hundred letters could not describe it. Even I could
not restrain myself but got off my horse, and ere they remounted I
embraced them all twice; once for myself and once for Lorenzo. Darling
little Giuliano said, with a long O, O, O, “Where is Lorenzo?” We
said, “He has gone to Poggio to find you.” Then he: “O no, never,”
almost in tears. You never beheld so touching a sight. He and Piero,
who has become a beautiful lad, the prettiest thing, by God, you ever
saw, somewhat grown, with the profile of an angel, and rather long
hair which stands out a little and is charming to see. Giuliano, red
and fresh as a rose, smooth, clear, and bright as a mirror, joyous
and with those contemplative eyes. Messer Giovanni also looks well,
not much colour, but healthy and natural; and Giulio has a brown and
healthy complexion.<a id="FNanchor_320" href="#Footnote_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a> All, in short, were happiness itself. And
thus with great joy and delight we went a happy party by Via Maggio,
Ponte a S. Trinità, S. Michele Berteldi, S. Maria Maggiore, Canto
alla Paglia, Via de’ Martelli, and entered the house, <i>per infinita
asecula aseculorum eselibera nos a malo amen</i>. I then rode to my
own house, and I have not seen them since as I found many things to
do. Nothing more.</p>

<p>Luigi left Florence this morning and went to Calcione or Balcione
or whatever his place is called, and his wife is in Florence. Tell
Francesco di Maestro Antonio,<a id="FNanchor_321" href="#Footnote_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a> my beloved and beautiful, that he
had his letter, was much pleased by it, and says he will reply by word
of mouth, as there was nought in it of moment he did not answer, but
begs him to forgive him, he will do it better in person. Take note of
this.</p>

<p>To my Andrea de’ Medici commend me with all thy might and tell him not
to forget my sea-shells. And come<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</span> back soon for the people can no
longer retain their impatience. In haste.—May 12, 1485.</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Franco.</span><br>
</p>

<p>I gave thy garter to the man thou toldest me. I quite understand that
he has not pleased the person who you said praised him: so that what
with this and our conversation in the fields I think it would be an
excellent thing to do as we decided. By word of mouth we will settle
all. <i>Vale iterum.</i></p>

<p>Say to Francesco that I went to his house and told his old woman that
he was well and would be at Poggio on Monday, at which she rejoiced.
I also went to the house of my Andrea de’ Medici: his womankind were
at vespers, but I saw the baby girl who was being fed; the sweetest
little fish in the world, she looks like a rose: and I left word that
he was well and would return on Monday. Commend me to him.</p>

<p class="center">
<i>Two of Piero’s Sayings</i><br>
</p>

<p>Returning from the festival at the Carmine together we passed my
house, so he came in and had some breakfast, and when we left as he
was putting on his <i>catelano</i> [overcoat] I said: “Piero, will
you not drink a little more?” When his coat was well on he said:
“Yes, just a little so as not to smell of Catelano,”<a id="FNanchor_322" href="#Footnote_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a> which made
us all laugh. The other: Passing near S. Maria Novella the house of
that Ser Francesco who kept a school for boys, and seeing that now a
carpenter was standing at the door which was open so that we could
see wood piled up inside, I said: “Oh dear, Ser Francesco who kept
the school must be dead,” and the carpenter answered that he was. I
exclaimed: “The devil! I am grieved for him!” Piero said: “Why ‘the
devil’? did you wish him to live more years than a life? He must have
been eighty.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</span> We laughed all the way to Piazza Madonna. I thought he
had heard this and only repeated it, but looking at him I saw by his
laughing face that he had said it of himself and on purpose.</p>

<p>Lorenzo declares (and it makes me laugh) that he will not have Piero
bothered, &amp;c.; the poor lad cannot go outside the door without all
Florence running after him; it is the same at home, they all try to
make him shine, though with decorum, on which he insists. But they
don’t care. It is of no use; they are all enthusiastic and cannot hold
their tongues. When Lorenzo goes out he will have to lock the boy in a
cupboard if he does not want to hear questions put to him to answer.
I cannot tell you what charm there is about him, so that all who talk
for a while with him are captivated.<a id="FNanchor_323" href="#Footnote_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a></p>

<p>Lorenzo not only borrowed but lent books in liberal fashion. Poliziano
was his librarian with a certain Meo <i>cartolaio</i> as his assistant,
who bound the manuscripts. Poliziano himself, Pico della Mirandola,
Messer Demetrio the Greek (Chalcondylas), John Lascaris, and Bernardo
Michelozzi, afterwards Bishop of Forlì, were among the most frequent
borrowers, and every book taken out of the library, even by Lorenzo or
his sons, was noted down in his <i>Epistolario</i>. Not only books,
but arms, silver dishes, bowls, goblets, salt-cellars, spoons, and
forks, were lent to various Podestà and to friends, even the Signoria
of Florence occasionally borrowed from him. The silver Lorenzo took
with him on hunting excursions or to the various baths he visited was
carefully recorded.</p>

<p>Yesterday evening at one of the night the Magnificent Lorenzo returned
and to-day I went to see him. His Magnificence said that during these
few days of absence he found that Milan had made observations about
the Signoria having despatched Ugolino Baccio, a private gentleman
of no official standing, to the Illustrious Duke of Calabria without
notifying the fact to the government of Milan; and that it seemed to
him that Milan and the Lord Lodovico did not remember that this city
called herself the city of liberty, and that she would be indeed in
evil plight if she could not send a man wherever she chose without
the permission of Milan, particularly when despatched to the Duke of
Calabria. Also that this city made no remark when the Lord Lodovico
made a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</span> treaty with Venice without informing this Signoria ... all
these things showed a rancorous and evil disposition.... That if Milan
ever needed help from here ... and in desperate need turned to this
people ... it would be impossible to persuade them to listen to her
request. He said that Villa was of no value to Milan, while to this
Signoria the place was of great importance, for if they lose hold of
that district and were at war with Genoa, instead of spending ten they
would have to spend sixty and even more.... He could not understand
whence arose the hatred shown by Milan to this Signoria and the
explosion of rage at the acquisition of a place of no importance. This
Signoria did not act thus towards Milan, nor towards the Marquis of
Mantua, nor towards Your Lordship; they have always aided, and spent
much treasure in trying to help all these princes to enrich themselves
at the expense of Venice. If this did not succeed it was not the fault
of this Signoria, who did all they could to aid in the matter. It
therefore seems strange to them that there should be such grumbling
about Villa. I then touched upon what Your Excellency wrote to me.
That it was not thought that Milan would again demand the restitution
of Villa but would wait until this Signoria decided upon attacking
Sarzana, when Villa would naturally fall to them.... His Magnificence
replied: “I will tell you all openly, only beg Your Lord to keep it
secret. This you must know has been thought of, but this city is not
inclined to undertake the enterprise of Sarzana during the next few
years, but to temporise until our affairs are more prosperous, for
we are quite aware that the Lord Lodovico has made an alliance with
Genoa, and that we could not count on help from him. The Lord Lodovico
shows that he does not understand the spirit that rules this city,
which is this: When we have embarked on an enterprise we continue
with ardour, when we are at peace it needs a great effort to make us
undertake one. Now that the Signoria has sheathed the sword it will
not unsheath it, save for very grave reasons.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</span> We know that 60,000
ducats would not suffice for an attempt on Sarzana.”... November 4,

<p><span class="smcap">Messer Aldrovandini</span>,—As soon as you receive this our letter
contrive to see the Magnificent Lorenzo <i>solus cum solo</i>, and
inform him most secretly that we are advised by our ambassador at
Venice that a Genoese envoy has arrived there in disguise, with secret
instructions from his prince, and his ambassador has asked that
Illustrious Signoria to enter into a treaty, and to give counsel and
aid against the Magnificent Signoria of Florence. Not desiring to make
this public, but on the contrary to keep it secret, they requested the
Illustrious Signoria of Venice to let Signor Roberto [San Severino]
enter his service, to whom his Commune offers 20,000 men for making
war against the Florentines. He complained that the Illustrious
Lord Lodovico kept his ambassadors some time in Milan and sent them
home without concluding anything, on the pretext that he wanted to
reconcile them with the Florentines, towards whom they say he is too
tender. It has been determined not to give an immediate answer to this
envoy but to keep him amused with hopes until it is known whether the
league and friendship which is now being arranged between the Pope and
the Signoria is concluded. To accelerate this the Signoria of Venice
have sent Antonio Vinciguerra their secretary in all haste to Rome,
who passed through here three nights ago on his way to Ravenna, where
horses were ready to take him to Rome. With him went a secretary of
the Legate, who is at Venice, sent by the Legate, so that by what we
see and hear the affair is on the point of being concluded unless
steps can be taken to stop it. Of the important results to Italian<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</span>
matters, <i>et presentim</i> to our Illustrious League, I leave the
Magnificent Lorenzo to judge. I beg you <i>ex corde</i> to keep this
news secret, for if by chance it was known from whence it came,
besides the danger our ambassador at Venice would run, you would lose
the benefit of being advised of matters which deeply concern that
Illustrious Signoria and His Magnificence.—Ferrara, November 18,

<p>This evening about 24 of the clock came the letter of Your Illustrious
Lordship. I went at once to the Magnificent Lorenzo and read him
the whole letter, entreating him in Your Excellency’s name to keep
it absolutely secret. When His Magnificence heard it I assure Your
Lordship that he remained for a time without opening his lips from
agony and rage, and then said: “I believe all that is evil of this
Pope, the more so that to-day I heard from Rome that S. Piero in
Vincula is going to Padua on the pretence of fulfilling a vow, but
really in order to conclude a league with the Venetians and settle
everything.” Then he added: “This ecclesiastical State has always
been the ruin of Italy, because being ignorant and not knowing how to
govern, the priests put the whole world in peril. If His Majesty puts
an end to the Barons, he will then teach the Pope to read.” About the
news that Signor Roberto was to lead the Genoese against him, &amp;c.,
he did not seem to care much, or to hold them in much estimation,
saying that they would need other men than the crews of galleys. He
then said: “If Signor Roberto is to be the instrument of this it is
not serious.” By these words I gathered that His Magnificence did not
greatly fear Signor Roberto on account of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</span> friendship existing
between them and that he meant, according to my poor judgment, that
Signor Roberto would not make war on Florence; though he did not
express himself clearly.—Florence, November 20, 1486.<a id="FNanchor_328" href="#Footnote_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a></p>

<p>I have yours of the 18th, 22nd, and 29th, and now answer what is most
important. As to the understanding between the Pope and the King I
have no fear that it will cause me trouble; for if I thought the
King did not understand the difference between one who has seriously
offended him and one who has aided him with all his might, I should
not have advised this city to help him. The confirmation of the
custom we have adopted of making princes of the relatives of Popes
displeases me, because I have experienced the evils it gives rise to,
and know that the more esteem one shows for others the less is shown
to oneself, and that one example entails others. I have come to the
conclusion that a union between Milan, ourselves, and the house of
Orsini would be to our advantage and to theirs, and anything that
indicates greater faith in others than in us weakens this bond. But
as the Lord Virginio [Orsini] is of a different opinion I give way,
particularly as Messer Gianjacopo [Trivulzio, Sforza’s general], who
is as prudent and expert as Papi Tani, is of his way of thinking. I
do not however repent of having spoken fully and openly about this,
unless the King or the Duke have taken offence, in which case I had
rather have bitten my tongue.</p>

<p>As to the other part of your letter in which you say you have heard
from Milan that the Duke has been told I am displeased at his seeking
to protect himself and obtain a following, it is false, and no man who
speaks the truth can say it. Give the Duke to understand that if I
believed that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</span> the frauds and lies of others would find credence with
His Excellency as against my actions, I think I should go and live
with the Turk. The proof of what my desire has been is that I always
counselled the Duke by letter, and in person at Citerna, to take
Colonessi into his service, and persuaded the Lord Virginio that this
was the proper thing. It appears to me unnecessary to make excuses, as
it might give rise to the idea that I was in fault, of which I am as
free as the day I was born. I am I think known as an upright man and
loyal, and one to be trusted by the Duke as fully as any man alive for
sincerity and a complete lack of prejudice. What I have done to aid
him was done without any design of benefiting the State or myself, of
my own free will and reason. He will see that I shall not trouble him
much or reproach him every hour as will probably be done by others. If
I have asked him for anything, as for example San Germano, I can truly
say it was rather offered to me than asked for, and whether I get it
or not, I shall continue the same line of conduct without any feeling
of anger, because I was actuated by higher motives which still affect
me. Messer Gianjacopo would do well to send you the Brief which he
mentioned to Pier Capponi as having already arrived, and which creates
more difficulties; and he would have done still better not to tell
the Pope the intentions of others with regard to the negotiations for
peace. I had given no authority to any one, and am more than content
that love and peace reigns between the King and the Lord Lodovico: for
if a good understanding does not exist between us peril and great loss
will ensue. I never consider that any good will come to me from harm
done to others. Perhaps some day God will open the eyes of all wider.
I am glad your expedition meets with the approval of the person you
mention, I will arrange that you shall find there any news I can give.
But as the Pope appears ill-disposed I have small faith in anything
that depends on him.</p>

<p>I am very glad that the Count’s affairs at Citerna have been arranged
not only to his satisfaction but in a way honourable to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</span> myself. Thank
Virginio [Orsini] heartily from me, to whom we owe this. And as I
understand he has arranged the affairs and interests of all the family
except those of Organtino [Orsini, Clarice’s eldest brother] entreat
him particularly also to arrange Organtino’s satisfactorily, making
him understand that I regard the affairs of His Holiness as being my
own. For the love of God, Baccio, bestir yourself with all your might
in this matter, I am most anxious about it, particularly for love of
Clarice. I long for peace at home as I see small reason to hope for it
abroad.—December 3, 1486.<a id="FNanchor_329" href="#Footnote_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>... Milan has written the most amiable letters to this Illustrious
Signoria about the affair of Sarzana, saying that they will expose
their State and their persons if necessary in the service of Florence.
These letters are explained by Milan having heard of the league
between the Pope and the Venetians, and finding that she cannot draw
the Pope on her side as she thought, she now tries to make friends
here. The Illustrious Lodovico has also written a most loving letter
to the Magnificent Lorenzo, saying that they have both erred, and
suggesting that the past be set aside and a clean page begun, when
the Magnificent Lorenzo will see that he will be a true and good
brother; and that he will not believe the past has been forgotten
unless some great service is demanded of him. These letters have been
most acceptable to the Magnificent Lorenzo....—Florence, December 10,
1486.<a id="FNanchor_330" href="#Footnote_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a></p>

<p>... Sarzana is being bombarded day and night by the Florentine troops,
and it is hoped that S. Francesco will be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</span> theirs in two days, when
Sarzana must fall. Some soldiers and officers have fled from the town
and say the inhabitants are in great straits and have begun to eat the
army biscuits, and that Messer Ettore Dal Fiesco, the commissary, is
hated for his extreme cruelty. Two of the mortars of this Illustrious
Signoria have burst. The Magnificent Lorenzo is at Pisa urging on the
capture of Sarzana; he has sent the big mortar from Pisa, and pioneers
in haste to the camp, whom he paid in advance as otherwise none would
go....—Florence, June 7, 1487.<a id="FNanchor_331" href="#Footnote_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a></p>

<p>The Magnificent Lorenzo has gone himself to the camp before Sarzana
to push on matters. S. Francesco has fallen....—Florence, June 9,
1487.<a id="FNanchor_332" href="#Footnote_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a></p>

<p>The Magnificent Lorenzo arrived here on the vigil of S. Giovanni (23rd
June) and was received with more joy and caresses by the people than I
can describe, as they say they owe the taking of Sarzana to him more
than to others....—Florence, June 26, 1487.</p>

<p>... The Magnificent Lorenzo said bitter words to me about the
Illustrious Signor Lodovico (il Moro), particularly as to the
withdrawal of his troops <i>ex abrupto</i> from the camp (before
Sarzana), saying the Signor Lodovico was so puffed up that he fancied
the Genoese would give him Castelletto and Genoa, but that time would
teach him better....—Florence, June 28, 1487.<a id="FNanchor_333" href="#Footnote_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a></p>

<p>... I again tried to persuade the Magnificent Lorenzo that he would
do well and wisely to let Your Highness try and dissipate this
misunderstanding between the Illustrious Messer Lodovico and His
Magnificence, and that I was sure Your Highness would be able to
arrange matters so that they would be greater friends than before.
His Magnificence was greatly perturbed and said Your Highness was
in a position to know how justified were the complaints of this
Signoria against the Signor Lodovico and then turned his back on me.
I attempted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</span> to ask him what this meant but in vain: he would not
answer. I confess I do not know what to infer from this. If Your
Excellency understands, so much the better. A friend told me that at
home His Magnificence talks like a desperate man, and says that he
would like to go for six months to some place where Italian affairs
would never be mentioned, and that your Excellency cannot imagine
what joy His Magnificence showed at the victory gained by the King of
France, and openly said he hoped to see the King master of all Italy.
From this one can only conceive that His Magnificence is very irate.
God turn his heart to act well....—Florence, July 7, 1487.<a id="FNanchor_334" href="#Footnote_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a></p>

<p>... The Magnificent Lorenzo continues to be desperately angry with the
Illustrious Messer Lodovico.... He spoke most terrible and desperate
words saying that Messer Lodovico was doing all he could to make the
Pope and the Florentines throw themselves at the feet of H.M. the
King, and that this should be done; that as Messer Lodovico wished
Italian affairs to go to the bad His Magnificence would aid and abet
him, &amp;c. What will happen I know not, but I do know that if he were
to act wisely they would come to some good understanding as did his
forefathers, and as Your Highness has told him several times. His
Magnificence sent off special messengers yester eve to Rome and to
Milan. May God guide this business to a good end, for to me it seems
that evil passions are rising here every day....—Florence, July 18,
1487.<a id="FNanchor_335" href="#Footnote_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a></p>

<p>... You are informed that the Illustrious Messer Lodovico [il Moro]
is ill; it seems he is afflicted with certain pains in the stomach
which give him great suffering. Therefore many friends of his and
of ours at Milan who are anxious about his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</span> health, have entreated
us to beg the Magnificent Lorenzo to send a certain Maestro Pietro
Leoni, an excellent doctor who is at Florence, to Milan, a man of
great knowledge who may perhaps cure this malady.<a id="FNanchor_336" href="#Footnote_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a> We therefore
desire that as soon as you receive this you go to the Magnificent
Lorenzo and in our name beg him as heartily as you can, for love of
us and for the interest we believe he takes in the health of the
Illustrious Lodovico, to send the said Maestro Pietro immediately to
Milan.—Ferrara, August 31, 1487.<a id="FNanchor_337" href="#Footnote_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a></p>

<p>... I hear from a good source that Messer Giovanni Jacopo de’ Trivulzi
has been commissioned by the Pope to tell the Magnificent Lorenzo that
he only sleeps with the eyes of the said Magnificent Lorenzo, that he
must advise him, the Pontiff, wisely and guide him; if he does so the
gain and the honour will be his; but if his advice be bad it will lead
to the ruin of both. The Pope complains as high as the third heaven of
the King’s conduct to him.<a id="FNanchor_338" href="#Footnote_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a> At the same time Messer Jacopo speaks
of the cowardice, misery, and sadness of the Pope, as one speaks about
a blackguard, and says that if he be not encouraged and helped to keep
up his spirits, he will sink lower than any coward ever sank. To-day
comes news that the King has appealed <i>ad novum Concilium contra
Pontificem</i> on account of his behaviour to H.M. This will I believe
frighten the Pope, for he is a very rabbit....—Florence, September 6,
1487.<a id="FNanchor_339" href="#Footnote_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a></p>

<p>... The Pope says the King cannot appeal because at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</span> Mantua, when
the Diet assembled in the time of Pope Pius, all the Italian princes
promised never to appeal <i>ad futurem Concilium</i>. <i>Item</i>
that H.M. expressly promised Pope Sixtus not to appeal, &amp;c. For these
reasons His Sanctity declares that he can proceed against the King.
But I think he will be cautious.—Florence, September 12, 1487.<a id="FNanchor_340" href="#Footnote_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a></p>

<p>... H.M. the King and the Duke of Calabria<a id="FNanchor_341" href="#Footnote_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a> declare that neither
through the King of Castile, or through Milan or Florence, have they
ever given a promise to pay tribute to the Pope. Here this declaration
is laughed to scorn as being made by cunning evildoers, <i>cum sit</i>
that Milan and Florence made the promise and the agreement was
signed with the Pope, so H.M. will have to pay the tribute. However
like wise men the Signori of Florence have resolved to ignore the
arrogant message of the King and the Duke, and to drink this bitter
cup....—Florence, November 7, 1487.<a id="FNanchor_342" href="#Footnote_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a></p>

<p>... To-day at 22 of the clock Messer Ascanio with fourteen horsemen
passed through here in disguise, riding hard by post to Milan. It
appears he has been summoned by the Milanese nobles because the death
of Messer Lodovico is expected. The Magnificent Lorenzo and the
Milanese ambassador saw His Excellency, but no one else as it was kept
secret and he did not enter the city.... Should Messer Lodovico die
the Magnificent Lorenzo will aid Messer Ascanio in every way to become
Lord of Milan. Some time ago he was of a different mind, but now he
will do everything to turn matters in the Pope’s favour and against
H.M. the King.... From a friend I learn that the Duke of Lorraine has
just been here in disguise and has seen the Magnificent Lorenzo at
night, who at once sent him on to the Pope.—Florence, November 18,

<p><i>Sanctissime, ac Beattissime Pater post Pedum oscula Beatorum
Vestorum</i>,—From our ambassador I hear that Your Holiness has seen
fit to suspend the affair of Nantes, and to defer granting the request
to the King of France. Although I must acquiesce in every decision of
Your Holiness, yet the reasons Your Holiness gives for delay cause
me to write again; for if the Most Christian King obtains his desire
he will be even more beholden to Your Sanctity, while my condition
and reputation will be enhanced. I am sure if Your Holiness knew the
help and the utility this would be to me, this business would not
be deferred, particularly as the King has in general no need of my
services, and such an occasion as the present comes but seldom. If the
love Your Holiness bears me is not shown in great matters, it will be
ill seen in small. With all humility therefore I beseech Your Holiness
to deign to grant me one of the greatest boons I could receive, and
to do a pleasure to H.M. the King. A pleasure which will be much
esteemed by H.M., and be most honourable and useful to me. There will
be no difficulty in it, and it cannot be unbecoming in Your Holiness
to satisfy the desire of so great a King, who is so well-deserving
<i>de Ecclesia Dei</i>, and at the same time to content me, Your
humble and devoted servant, who humbly commends himself at Your Holy
Feet.—Florence, December 8, 1487. <i>Humilis servitor</i>,</p>

<p>... The Pope has been much cheered by the assurances of the Venetian
envoys, who openly say that their Signoria<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</span> only hastened to make
peace with the Germans, in order to come to the aid of His Sanctity
and the honour of the Holy See ... and to force His Majesty the King
to keep the promises made to His Sanctity.... Milan has written here
that she considers the King ought to be informed that should he
fail to arrange matters with the Pope, and the Pope declares war,
he is not to expect help from either Florence or Milan.... As yet
these Signori have not come to any decision, but I think they will
join Milan in this.... As to the Venetians I do not believe they
would bother themselves with such an enterprise, unless they saw a
chance of gaining something in addition to the hatred they bear the
King....—Florence, December 18, 1487.<a id="FNanchor_345" href="#Footnote_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a></p>

<p>... The Magnificent Lorenzo is of opinion that the Pope should rather
be held back than pushed forward, and that the King should not be
irritated, thus His Magnificence thinks we might have peace and
quiet, if the contrary is done he fears that disaster will ensue....
The Magnificent Lorenzo is extremely discontented with the Pope’s
behaviour, and thinks he shows greater folly every day and every
hour, particularly if he insists in launching interdicts against the
King.... As to the letters written from Milan, which I mentioned
in mine of the 18th, the answer was that as allies they could only
applaud the idea of letting the King know that they desired to stand
well with the Pope, &amp;c. The reply was airy: they did not desire to be
explicit.</p>

<p>From a friend I learn that the Magnificent Lorenzo spoke in different
terms to the Milanese ambassador, saying, that as Messer Lodovico’s
condition prevents him from attending to business, it seems to him
unwise to irritate the King, particularly as H.M. has everything
ready and is prepared for war, while the Pope is without troops
and with small brains, has bad advisers, and all the Roman Barons
against him. The worst of all being that neither the Pope, nor Milan,
nor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</span> Florence, have any commander if they wished to go to war,
&amp;c....—Florence, December 28, 1487.<a id="FNanchor_346" href="#Footnote_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a></p>

<p>... The Magnificent Lorenzo is of opinion that the acts of the Pope
will be worse than his words. The ambassadors of the League have
arranged with His Sanctity that Imola and Forlì should go to the
Count’s sons,<a id="FNanchor_347" href="#Footnote_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a> but the Magnificent Lorenzo believes that from
what he hears the children have been poisoned. In this case the
Pope has every claim on that State as being Church property and the
Lords invested by the Church being dead ... His Magnificence would
far rather see Forlì and Imola in private hands than in those of a
powerful prince. But if they are to belong to a potentate he had
rather it should be Milan than the Church; for Milan has several
Baronies, and might bestow the State on some lord, as did Duke
Galeazzo, but the Church would never do so, as for some time she has
been a sworn enemy to the Barons and the Lords, and whatever she
seizes she holds. Also the rule of the Church is so admirable that it
does harm to its neighbours! And although I argued with him to see
whether these were his real convictions he remained staunch, saying
that the time would come when the Church would be more dangerous than
the Signoria of Venice, and that this belief more than anything else
induced him to favour H.M. the King [of Naples]....—Florence, April

<p>Poliziano accompanied Piero de’ Medici to Rome to meet his bride
Alfonsina Orsini, to whom he had been married by proxy at Naples in
February the year before. His mother Clarice, who was very ill, had
been in Rome since November hoping, as consumptive people do, that the
milder air would cure her. With her had gone her favourite daughter,
“the eye of her head,” Maddalena, affianced to the Pope’s illegitimate
son Francesco Cibò. Piero and his wife, Clarice and Maddalena, all
returned together to Florence, Lorenzo having begged the Pope and Cibò
to allow Maddalena to come with her sick mother. With her, when she
went to Rome, he had sent Matteo Franco, “one of the dearest creatures
of my house,” he calls him, to keep the young girl company, and to
look after her. How well the humorous, kindly priest fulfilled his
trust, how cordially he disliked both Genoese and Romans, and how he
longed for the brilliant society of the Medici palace is shown in the
following letter. Cibò, a gambler, ignorant and stupid, had sense
enough to recognise how invaluable Franco was, and although he raised
no objection to Maddalena’s going with her mother, he refused to part
with Franco.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>O revered, sweet, and good brother mine, where art thou at this
moment? what art thou doing? art thou well? Hast thou so soon
forgotten thy Franco who eating or sleeping only dreams of his dear
soul Ser Piero? This I will never believe, far rather would I imagine
that thou art hurt because I have written so seldom; that thou art
sorry because I am not near thee, thy companions and affairs; and
above all that thou art sorry because thou dost not see the expected
fruit of thy kind and loving sowing, of thy many heartfelt letters
in my favour, of all the kind things said about me to my lord and of
thy expectation founded on the esteem and love thou bearest me. All
this gladdens and yet distresses me; gladdens me because I rejoice in
possessing so good and true a friend; distresses me when I think that
all thy trouble has been in vain by no fault of mine. But, sweet Ser
Piero, do not lose faith in me, as I do not lose it in thee, good will
come of it all.</p>

<p>Thou must know that till now we have come out of all with honour,
<i>id est</i> thy Franco, as Franco, towards his masters, towards
thee, and towards himself, has done well despite of malignant,
venomous and treacherous, envious, &amp;c. I came, and on the road and
whilst in Rome, with all the love and economy I was able to employ
was so useful to my masters that they showed their appreciation by
words and deeds many times; particularly when I stood aloof and they
tried others. Of the money received by me for the expenses, my enemies
twice carefully dissected, like anatomists, my accounts, shop by shop,
day by day, entry by entry; and everything was in such order that
calumny had a fall, and they were laughed at and put to shame. Thus
my affection, fidelity, and diligence were established and talked of
publicly by them as I heard privately,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</span> so that I pardon all. When
I made up the final balance only twenty-eight lire were missing,
which must have been forgotten by the man who buys retail. This would
be of small account if I had not lost so much in brains, soul, and
body, instead of only twenty-eight lire, in all these devilries and
persecutions, &amp;c., so that I even once cursed both thee and Lorenzo
who sent me into this hell. But God has helped us, for of a certain
Lorenzo, thou, and my own good intentions, could not have a bad ending.</p>

<p>All this, my Ser Piero, must be a comfort to thee as it is to me.
Also I cannot describe the kindness and love shown to me by Madonna
Clarice, twice or thrice she even said that the Count showed small
discretion in taking me from her, exclaiming: “See how I am left, I
will not allow any man to have the spending of my money but Franco;
and I will eat nothing but what has passed through his hands; we never
intended to give Franco to him in order that he might be buried alive
in a wood, he would be far more useful to Madonna Maddalena and to his
house if he were here at hand, &amp;c.” She talked of this a hundred times
and has already sent for me twice since I have been at these baths,
and kept me two or three days until his Lordship drove me back to the
baths.</p>

<p>It was rumoured that Maddalena was to go to Florence with Alfonsina
and a list was drawn up of things she was going to ask of the Count
for her journey; among others she desired:</p>

<p>“As chaplain I wish for Franco.</p>

<p>“And some one to write my letters, for this Franco will be good.</p>

<p>“And I should like Your Excellency’s necklace for the time I am in
Florence, and such a dress and such footmen, &amp;c., if it please you,
&amp;c.” The list was given to my lord in the evening and after reading
it he replied: “All thou askest I give thee willingly, save only
Franco and my necklace.” The girl replied: “Madonna Clarice desires
that he should come.” “And I desire that he should stay. They have
nought more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</span> to do with Franco once Lorenzo has given him to thee, and
I desire that thou leavest him to look after thy interests for the
income of the baths I intend for thee. Thou seest how I am robbed by
all. He has done more in the fifteen days he has been there than all
my other people since I had Cervetri.”</p>

<p>These words were repeated to me by my angel mistress and lady, who has
doubtless wept more than once with Madonna Baccia over my coming to
stay here, for Madonna Baccia writes that she talks of me and calls
me every hour. Were it not for this and for the thought of him there,
who is my soul and my heart, of whom I think in all my tribulations
so that by the true God, Ser Piero, melancholy then flies from me and
my heart is so consoled that my soul is kept in my body. Otherwise
I should have died a hundred times. Enough. I might go on and tell
that every day I hear how my lord praises me, and I hope from these
baths to get great honour, &amp;c., and a hundred other expectations from
friends and models made in Rome. But as I do not want to break thy
head I skip: enough that I have let off a little bile; I wanted to
tell thee something about my life. I have been here at the baths of
Stigliano since March 12th, saving the few days Madonna Clarice sent
for me as I said; and have already arranged the baths Tuscan fashion.
The rooms are disgusting, Bagno a Morba is a Careggi in comparison;
the air is accursed, the men are like Turks; everything as bad as can
be. Day and night I have to struggle with <i>bravi</i>, with soldiers,
with swindlers, with venomous dogs, with lepers, with Jews, with
madmen, with thieves, and with Romans. Now I run to the cook, now
to the baker, then to the tavern, then to clients in the inns; then
I argue with the discontented, with the sick in the hospital, then
with the pedlar, then with the grocer, then with the chemist; then I
go to the washerwoman, then to the grooms, then to the courier, then
to the doctor, then to the priest. For I have transported all these
people here; there were but bare walls and only half of them standing.
In short I have had to bring<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</span> from the smallest to the largest thing
which may be needful for perhaps ten thousand people into this forest,
so that every man may have, by paying, every convenience he wants. And
I am alone to manage all. During this month of May never a day has
passed but there have been a hundred or a hundred and fifty persons;
rooms, beds, even the courtyard, all are full, and some days there
have been more than three hundred. Most of them stay three days and
then go; and I have to receive them all, to see to their food, to
provide what they want and have not brought with them, grass, oats,
hay, in short, everything. For all this they have to pay me, so I
hope to glean more than four hundred ducats for Madonna Maddalena if
God gives me health. With cooks, innkeepers, bakers and so on, I have
about twenty-five men in my pay; and if you could see your Franco
in this tempest and purgatory and whirl, host of this great inn of
the devil, by God you would pity him. They comfort me by saying that
Christ must wish me well if I escape without a beating, a knife in my
ribs, a quarrel, or an illness, for no one has ever returned whole
from here, God be praised for His mercies. Yet I am of good cheer and
have such faith in my fair dealing that I hope to do myself honour, if
it pleases God. Till now I have pocketed about a hundred ducats, and
all sorts and conditions of men have come. If I have not gained with
the bad ones I have not lost; most went away contented. From those of
the better sort, couriers, gentlemen, and the like, I think I have
gained affection and esteem, for since they returned to Rome they have
written to me and sent me presents. Some day I hope to find a great
joy, I even hope in the —— of Lucifer the Great, serving for the
love of God, of Lorenzo and of what is his. <i>Vale.</i>—May 6, 1488.</p>

<p>The rejoicings for Piero’s marriage were suddenly turned to mourning.
Lorenzo’s second daughter Luisa, betrothed to her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</span> cousin Giovanni, of
the junior branch of the Medici, died at the age of sixteen, so bride
and bridegroom went to Careggi without entering Florence. Early in
June, however, a magnificent banquet was given in honour of Alfonsina,
to which all the foreign ambassadors and the chief citizens of the
city were invited. Soon afterwards arrived Francesco Cibò, and for the
first time since the Pazzi conspiracy in 1478 the day of S. Giovanni
(24th June) was again celebrated with great magnificence. The peasants
flocked into Florence to see the Pope’s son, husband of the gentle
Maddalena, and the crowd saluted him with loud cries of “<i>Cibò e
Palle</i>.” Serdonati’s account of Lorenzo’s home life, apropos of
these festivities, is interesting.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“When in 1488 Francesco went to Florence to celebrate his marriage he
took many knights and noble persons with him, the flower of the Roman
nobility. He was received with great splendour and lodged with all
his people right royally. But soon Lorenzo, taking pleasure in seeing
his son-in-law familiarly, or perchance thinking to gain still more
the Pope’s benevolence, continually invited him to dine at his house
without ceremony, or as we say <i>alla casalinga</i>. Now it appears
that the Florentines are generally held to be chary of spending
their money, so he thought that those gentlemen who had accompanied
him to honour his wedding might be treated in like manner, and was
sore troubled, fearing that the city of Florence and his relations
would be held up to ridicule afterwards in Rome. Afraid to hear
what he did not wish, he dared not ask how they fared. But one day
a Roman gentleman who was intimate with him saw how full of thought
he was and asked the reason. He answered that although he knew his
father-in-law Lorenzo was a man of great reputation and worth, yet he
felt mortified, because on account of the usage of the city or for
some other reason his friends were treated in too homely a fashion. He
was therefore pained, but it might be remedied by a speedy departure,
and in Rome he would indemnify them for any discomforts or annoyances
they had undergone. The cavalier, astonished, replied that had the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</span>
Pope himself been lodged as they were he could not have complained, or
been more magnificently entertained, cared for, served and honoured,
and that no one could desire more. So delighted was Francesco to
hear this that he could not contain himself and recounted all to his
father-in-law, who with great urbanity replied that children, among
whom he now reckoned Francesco, and strangers and noble persons, such
as had accompanied him, were to be treated differently; the latter
with all magnificence, partly for their own merits, partly out of
respect for him and to do him honour; but that between him and his
own children he had made no difference. This gave much pleasure and
satisfaction to Francesco and greatly pleased the Pope when he heard
of it, and all admired the wisdom and prudence of Lorenzo in all
things both public and private.”<a id="FNanchor_351" href="#Footnote_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a></p>

<p>I have seen Pier Filippo Pandolfini twice, who is the heart of Lorenzo
in the Council and the first citizen of Florence ... to tell him
according to your Excellency’s instructions that we will do anything
rather than break with Milan. He replied that they would never commit
the error of breaking, but <i>etiam</i> that they would never consent
to anything that would dishonour or disgrace this city. Florence, he
said, is neither Cremona nor Pavia, which are subject to the State of
Milan, and he thought Milan wished to treat the Florentines as though
they were her subjects ... and that now this Signoria [Florence] had

<p>... The Illustrious Signori Eight sent for me to-day; with them was
the Magnificent Lorenzo and several citizens, and they told me the
news from Faenza. The imprisonment of Messer Giovanni [Bentivoglio]
and of Madonna, the death of Count Giampiero del Bergamino [Captain
of the Milanese troops], and that the people insisted that the son of
Messer Galeotto should be installed as their Lord under the protection
of Florence. The Eight had already recalled their Commissary who had
been sent to Castrocaro and he had arrived at Faenza. This Illustrious
Signoria has decided to accept the guardianship and protection of the
State of Faenza for the ward, son of Messer Galeotto, and has thus
written, and has ordered troops to march towards Faenza, &amp;c.<a id="FNanchor_354" href="#Footnote_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a>
I fear, Illustrious Lord, that this year is the beginning of the
thirteen disastrous months. All the condottieri who had been dismissed
by this Illustrious Signoria they now show a desire to re-engage,
indeed they have already begun to do so. My own feeling is that never
was a greater need of attempting a reconciliation between the State of
Milan and this Illustrious Signoria, and Your Excellency must strip to
your shirt and use all your wisdom. It is a fact that Messer Galeotto
was a soldier and a <i>raccomandato</i> (under the protection) of this
Signoria, and to them belongs the guardianship of the State and the
boy more than to others, particularly as the people themselves demand
it.—Florence, June 5, 1488.<a id="FNanchor_355" href="#Footnote_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a></p>

<p>... Yesterday I was with the Magnificent Lorenzo in S. Liberata [the
cathedral] for full two hours talking about setting the Magnificent
Messer Giovanni at liberty. His Magnificence replied that Your
Excellency could write to and treat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</span> with this Signoria as you
pleased, and also with His Magnificence, but that he had warned
Madonna Ginevra [wife of Giovanni Bentivoglio] to abstain from begging
others to intercede for his liberation; hinting broadly to me that
Messer Lodovico [Sforza] should not be asked to interfere ... that
until matters were arranged at Faenza Messer Giovanni must take
patience, as this Signoria would support the people of Faenza until
everything was in order.<a id="FNanchor_356" href="#Footnote_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a></p>

<p>This morning the Illustrious Eight sent for me to announce that the

<p>... After the Magnificent Lorenzo had seen Messer Giovanni
[Bentivoglio], who had been set at liberty and was in Florence, I went
to hear what had passed between them. His Magnificence told me there
had been much talk and that all the linen had been washed clean. It
seemed to him that Messer Giovanni was quite satisfied and bore no
rancour against this city or against himself, and had promised to
represent matters to Milan so that nothing more would be said about
Faenza.... At daylight the Magnificent Lorenzo left to take the baths
at Villa (Filetta). His wife is very ill,<a id="FNanchor_358" href="#Footnote_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a> and there is no hope of
her recovery.—Florence, July 21, 1488....<a id="FNanchor_359" href="#Footnote_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a></p>

But the death of Clarice, which has just occurred,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</span> my most dear and

such a grief to me for many reasons, that it has exhausted my patience
and my power of enduring anguish, and the persecution of fortune,
which I did not think would have made me suffer thus. The deprivation
of such habitual and such sweet company has filled my cup and has made
me so miserable that I can find no peace. Nought is left but to pray
God that He may give me peace, and I have faith that in His infinite
love He will alleviate my sorrow and not overwhelm me with so many
disasters as I have endured during these last years. I humbly beg Your

<p>... I wrote that Madonna Clarice was ill, she died three days ago,
but I did not send the news at once as it did not seem to me of much
importance. Now that I am despatching the courier with letters from
Naples I inform Your Excellency. She died last Wednesday at 24 of
the clock and was buried without pomp that evening. The Magnificent
Lorenzo is at Filetta taking the waters and the baths and the doctors
advise him strongly not to come to Florence, also his friends have
written to persuade him to remain and finish his cure, and this he
will do. To-day, according to the custom here, the funeral service
will take place at 21 of the clock. The whole city and the ambassadors
of H.M., of Milan, and myself, have been invited. But before I
received the invitation I went with the Milanese ambassador to the
house of the Magnificent Lorenzo,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</span> and we condoled with Piero, the
Magnificent’s eldest son, in the names of our Lords in such words as
seemed fitted to the occasion.—Florence, August 1, 1488.<a id="FNanchor_361" href="#Footnote_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a></p>

<p>Lorenzo’s grief for the loss of Clarice, to whom he was sincerely but
not passionately attached, was mitigated by the information that his
heart’s desire—the nomination of his second son Giovanni, a boy of
fourteen, to the cardinalate—would not be long delayed. The lad was
already abbot of Font Doulce, in the gift of the King of France, of
Passignano in Tuscany bestowed on him by the Pope, of Miramondo given
by Lodovico il Moro, and of the great abbey of Monte Cassino <i>in
commendam</i> given to him by Ferrante, King of Naples. Innocent VIII.
had declared he would make no cardinals under the age of thirty, but
in March 1489 he yielded to Lorenzo’s entreaties, on the understanding
that the nomination was to be kept secret for three years, and was
exceedingly irate when it was divulged.</p>

<p>... Some Corsicans on the pretence of buying wheat from the Castellan

may be allowed to keep it, because together with many others in that
district it once was the property of his ancestors. Also that when his
own engagement ceases at the end of February he intends to recuperate
the others which are held by Siena. I wished to know how things
really stood from the Magnificent Lorenzo, and he assured me that the
engagement of the Count of Pitigliano would be prolonged and that he
will give up the castle. And this I believe....—Florence, January 21,

<p><span class="smcap">Magnificent Lorenzo</span>,—In my letter of yesterday evening
I described the entry of Madonna the Duchess.<a id="FNanchor_364" href="#Footnote_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a> Now I tell you
of the marriage. This morning we attended the marriage mass in the
cathedral, a most beautiful and splendid ceremony as Your Magnificence
will understand after reading this. First all the Court and the
guests assembled at the castle. At 15 of the clock the Duke, my Lord
Lodovico, the Barons and other gentlemen, went to fetch Madonna the
Duchess, and they all mounted and left the castle in pairs. At the
door was a canopy of white damask emblazoned with the Duke’s arms,
borne by forty doctors all dressed in crimson satin with certain fur
round their necks, and their caps were also garnished with the same
fur. Their Excellencies the Duke and Madonna rode side by side to the
Duomo under the canopy. The mass was sung by the Duke’s choristers
and celebrated by the Bishop of Piacenza, and at the close the Bishop
of Sanseverino gave an appropriate address. Then the Duke gave the
ring to the Duchess. When all was finished the Illustrious Lord Duke
knighted our Piero<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</span> Allamanni<a id="FNanchor_365" href="#Footnote_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a> and the Magnificent Bartolomeo
Calcho, and bestowed on Piero a robe of golden brocade as rich and
beautiful as can be. Truly a most honourable act. Messer Galeazzo
and the Count di Cajaza buckled on the spurs and the swords. Then
the whole company mounted and returned to the castle with great
rejoicing and pomp. It is calculated there were about five hundred
horses. Thirty-five divers Orders of friars and priests preceded the
procession to the Duomo; sixty knights clothed in gold brocade with
their collars; fifty women, twenty-eight were dressed in gold brocade
with pearls, jewels, and fine necklaces; sixty-two trumpeters, and
twelve fifers. The distance from the castle to the Duomo is 1200 paces
and it was all covered in with white cloth, and the walls on either
side were hung with tapestry and festoons of juniper and orange.
Nothing finer was ever seen. All the doors and windows were crowded
with women and girls splendidly dressed, and to avoid any crush or
tumult all the streets leading into this principal one were barred,
while at every corner stood ten or twelve guards. In the cathedral
square were stationed two hundred Stradiots (Greek troops) and
crossbow-men on horseback. Everything was so well managed that there
was not the slightest disorder, a marvellous thing considering the
innumerable multitude of people in this city. It is true that there
was great rigour about bearing arms; no one, save our own people who
always went armed, were allowed to carry weapons.</p>

<p>His Excellency the Duke had a vest of raised gold brocade, richer and
finer than can be described, in his cap was a diamond ornament with
a pearl bigger than a hazelnut, quite round, of great value. On his
breast was a pendant with a ruby and a diamond above it, truly a most
admirable thing.</p>

<p>Her Excellency the Duchess also wore brocade, and on her head was a
garland of pearls with very fine jewels. There were many other women
most richly dressed, but I do not write their names because I do not
know them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</span></p>

<p>Messer Annibale had a robe of golden brocade with stripes of black
velvet and where it opened on his breast was an eagle in pearls which
made a good show, though it was not costly, but rather what one would
call pretty.</p>

<p>The Lords Lodovico and Galeotto, the Lord Ridolfo and the rest of the
Sforza family were dressed in brocade, and it is calculated that there
were some three hundred thus clothed in silver and gold. Of velvet and
satin I do not speak because even the cooks wore them.</p>

<p>The robe of our Piero with the bough embroidered on it<a id="FNanchor_366" href="#Footnote_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a> was much
admired and according to my thinking eclipsed all the others. To-day
their Excellencies sent for him, being desirous to see and examine it,
and indeed every one was loud in their praise. I know I have written
confusedly and without any order: by word of mouth if it pleases God,
we will enter into detail with more leisure than I now have, as I must
ride with Piero to Court. I have no more to say save that I commend
myself to Your Magnificence.—Milan, February 2, 1488 (1489).<a id="FNanchor_367" href="#Footnote_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a></p>

Duke of Ferrara, and have understood what Your Magnificence writes
about the remedy you desire, for <i>in doloribus juncturarum</i>,
entering into details, and when and how, &amp;c. To<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</span> begin with, <i>ante
omnium</i> Your Magnificence must be purged before the beginning
of spring—that is, before the middle of March. Then if pains are
felt the part is to be rubbed with the ointment made according to
the recipe I have given to Messer Aldovrandini, which he will send
to Your Magnificence. The pains will then cease, but should they
return, and even if they do not return, some medicine must be taken
to carry off the offending matter. My medicine is a conserve made up
in solid form called <i>ellescof</i>, half an ounce is to be taken
at sunrise once a month, particularly when Your Magnificence feels
any pain. In order to prevent the return of these pains you must get
a stone called sapphire, and have it set in gold, so that it should
touch the skin. This must be worn on the third finger of the left
hand. If this is done the pains in the joints, or gouty pains, will
cease, because that stone has occult virtues, and the specific one
of preventing evil humours going to the joints: <i>ego autem hoc
expertus sum in me. Est enim divina res et miraculosa.</i> Afterwards
in the summer, in the month of August, I will find celandine, which
is a red stone that grows in the stomach of the swallow. I will send
it to Your Magnificence to be tied in a piece of linen and sewn in
your shirt under the left breast at the nipple. This will have the
same effect as the sapphire afore-mentioned, and thus <i>Deo Duce</i>
Your Magnificence will be freed of and secure from every pain in the
joints. Messer Aldovrandini will see Your Magnificence, and tell you
fully about it. In order that Your Magnificence should be acquainted
with the future I send you herein enclosed my forecast for the year
1488, and commend myself a thousand times to Your Excellency whom may

<p>Thanks be to God for the good news which I received yester morning at
nine from our Messer Giovanni [Tornabuoni]. It seems to me all the
greater because I expected less, and it is so far more than I deserve,
and so difficult of attainment, that it appeared almost impossible. I
have, indeed, reason ever gratefully to remember him who has worked so
hard, and I shall leave my gratitude recorded for those who come after
me, as this is the greatest honour that has ever befallen our house.
Let it suffice to you that I know this; most assuredly more than
three-fourths are due to your diligence, industry, and affection. But
we will speak of this another time. To the Holy Father I have written
a letter which is enclosed. I also write to Bala [Cardinal La Balue]
and Ascanio [Cardinal Sforza], the only ones from whom as yet I have
had letters. From you I expect full details about various things which
are mentioned below. I know not if our Holy Father was displeased at
the demonstrations of joy which were universal here. Never have I seen
more true and general rejoicing. Much more would have been done, only
I forbade it, but this I could not prevent. I say this, because Messer
Giovanni’s promotion being secret these demonstrations seemed contrary
to the intention, but it was a thing of such public notoriety in Rome
that people here can hardly be blamed for following the example set
there, and I could not refuse to accept the congratulations of all
these citizens, down to the very poorest. If it was unseemly it was
impossible to prevent, and I should be glad if you can explain this.
Also I much wish to know how to order Messer Giovanni’s future life;
how he is to dress, and what household he is to have, for I do not
desire to repay so great a boon by doing anything against the wishes
of our Holy Father. Meanwhile Messer Giovanni is in our house,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</span>
which has been full of people since yesterday. Let me know therefore
what I am to do. Also if he has occasion to write how is he to sign,
and what seal is he to use? About the Bull I know you will take all
precautions, and send it to me for the satisfaction of our friends.
I send you herein his height, but he seems to me to have grown since
yesterday, and to have changed. I trust to God that he will do honour
to all your labour, and that our Holy Father will every day be better
pleased with him. I wait to know whether I am to send Piero as I
wrote, for to me it seems this great gift demands that I should come
in person. I shall follow your advice in everything.—[March 14,

<p>With the greatest reverence I have received a Brief from Your Sanctity
of the 9th, in which you deign to acquaint me of the promotion of
Messer Giovanni (to the Cardinalate). Having already heard of it
through our ambassador I wrote at once with my own hand to Your
Holiness, rather to confess my inability to give adequate thanks than
to demonstrate my gratitude; our Lord God can do that better than I.
For a long time Your Sanctity has had the disposal of myself and of

bestowed on Messer Giovanni, whom I give to Your Holiness as a thing

be more Your Holiness’ than mine. As to keeping this affair secret I
should be much distressed if the knowledge of it had been made public
by me. But Your Holiness may rest assured that it was immediately
known in Rome, and then divulged by letters to people here, so that
every one came to congratulate me. I can affirm that the news was
not published by me, nor did I cause any demonstration<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</span> of joy to
be made. In any case, whether by my fault or not, I am extremely
distressed that Your Holiness should have experienced any annoyance,
and can only promise in the future to carry out to the letter any
commands Your Holiness deigns to give me. I entreat Your Holiness to
make Your wishes known to me, of which I shall be the faithful and

that they have been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</span> some time at Bologna. Some hold the report to be
unfounded and that these men came for another purpose. Nevertheless
they have been subjected to such a stringent examination that it has
raised suspicions among the ambassadors. They were examined by the
principal citizens, relations, and intimate friends of the Magnificent
Lorenzo.... This evening I hear that a horseman arrived from Messer
Giovanni Bentivoglio, and I have found out that he was sent to the
King’s ambassador by the said Messer Giovanni, who anxiously begs H.M.
to take steps for the release of these prisoners; the King has written
to say that about six months ago they were sent to him by the Duke of
Calabria with a request that they might be engaged in his army, and he

as I do on Your Holiness, and Your Holiness’ life being of such
importance, I cannot but feel uneasy even at a small indisposition,

Your Holiness more nearly than myself, and that is the sad condition
of poor Ser Francesco, who in the five years of the pontificate of
Your Holiness has never yet had anything he can call his own. Your
Holiness is the best judge of what support he enjoys in the Sacred
College and what office, dignity or means, he has to enable him
to live, even poorly. If Your Holiness studies the lives of other
Popes you will see that there are but few who during five years of
pontifical rule, and some in even less time, have not manifested
their intention of acting as a Pope, and have not shown the respect
for honesty and uprightness displayed by Your Holiness, which is
justified before God and man. But speaking as a devoted servant, this
honesty might now be imputed and attributed to another motive. Maybe
I appear presumptuous, but zeal and the duty I owe to Your Holiness
so touch my conscience that I must speak thus openly and remind Your
Holiness that all men are mortal, and that a Pope is what he wills to
be; he cannot leave the Papacy as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</span> a heritage and can only call his
own the honours, the glory and the benefits, he gives to his family.
The prudence, experience and long acquaintance Your Sanctity has of a
court, will I am sure without words from me, recall to Your Holiness
what always happens to the fortune and inheritance of popes, and
seeing that Ser Francesco and the others of Your Holiness’ family are
as yet not to be envied but rather merit compassion, Your Sanctity
ought to follow the example of Your Holiness’ predecessors and place
them in such a position that they should have no need of others,
particularly as whatever is bestowed on them does not diminish the
substance of Your Holiness and is not lost or thrown away. Briefly,
with all humility, I entreat Your Sanctity at last to begin and act
as a Pope with regard to the family of Your Holiness and not to trust
so much in posterity and good health, which can only retard the
fulfilment of what Your Holiness intends to do for them. Delay might
perhaps prevent this being accomplished. Especially do I recommend
Your and my Ser Francesco and the Lady Maddalena, who pray that God
may grant Your Holiness a long life in order that their affairs may be
properly adjusted, and when better arranged they will give thanks to
God and to Your Holiness, and have reason to remember and to bless the
day when Your Sanctity was called to the honours and dignity of the
pontificate. It is time, Holy Father, to liberate these Holy Fathers
from limbo, so that it may not happen to them as to the Jews who
awaited the Messiah. I beg Your Holiness’ pardon with all humility and
reverence for this my presumption only caused by reasons which I am
sure Your Holiness will appreciate, and I place myself humbly at Your
most holy feet.—1489. <i>Humilis Servitor</i>,</p>

<p>According to the usual custom and rule we advise you that to-day the
Magnificent Lorenzo has lent Pope Innocent 100,000 ducats for a year;
one-third in cash, one-third in silk goods, and one-third in woollen
cloth. As surety he has two-tenths on the stipends of all newly
appointed priests, 70,000 ducats, and for the rest he will hold Città
di Castello until entirely repaid.</p>

<p>I give you another piece of news: Pope Innocent has given the
Magnificent Lorenzo 30,000 cántara of alum at 1 ducat the cántaro
as payment of what was owing to him by Pope Sixtus, the 40,000 he
received for the war, which is good news.—Florence, 1489. Your
servant and particular partisan,</p>

</p>
</div>

<p>It appears that Lorenzo’s share in the bank was one-half, the other
half belonged to various partners. The Duke of Ferrara wrote on the
20th December 1489 to Giuliano Gondi announcing that he had arranged
a marriage for his daughter Isabella with the Marquess of Mantua on
the 16th February 1490, and begged for a spinel ruby which was in pawn
for 4000 ducats with the Magnificent Lorenzo &amp; Co. in order to wear it
during the festivities. He also wrote to Lorenzo asking that the ruby
might be sent, saying that he could not pay the money at that moment.
But Lorenzo answered that he could only promise for the half as the
other belonged to various merchants. So the Duke again wrote to Gondi
and asked him to go surety for him for 2000 ducats repayable in April
1492, guaranteed on the salt mines of Modena, &amp;c. Lorenzo was also a
partner in the bank at Lyons with Francesco Sassetti and others, of
which the manager was Leonetto de’ Rossi, husband of Maria de’ Medici,
Lorenzo’s sister. Machiavelli’s statement that Lorenzo had nothing to
do with the bank is contradicted by the above letter.</p>

<p>The Count della Mirandola is here leading a most saintly life, like a
monk. He has been and is now occupied in writing admirable theological
works: commentaries and Psalms; and other excellent books on theology.
He recites the ordinary priest’s office, observes all fasts and
absolute chastity: has but a small retinue and lives quite simply
with only what is necessary. To me he appears an example to other
men. He is anxious to be absolved from what little contumacy is still
attributed to him by the Holy Father and to have a Brief by which His
Holiness accepts him as a son and a good Christian, he persevering
in a Christian life. I greatly desire that this satisfaction should
be given to him, for there are few men I love better or esteem more.
I feel certain that he is a devout and faithful Christian, and his
conduct is such that the whole city would vouch for him. Do all you
can to obtain this Brief in such a form that it may content his
conscience. This would be not less agreeable to me than any one

<p>To my great vexation I hear how this work of Mirandola’s is abused,
and were I not sure that such persecution is dictated solely by
envy and malignity, by my faith, I should not mention it. The book
has been examined by all the most learned priests here, well-known
men of saintly life, and has been highly approved of by them as a
Christian and a marvellous work. I am not so bad a Christian as to
remain silent or to encourage him if I thought otherwise. I am certain
that if he recited the <i>Credo</i> those spiteful men would say it
was rank heresy. If His Holiness had the intelligence to understand
this and was not too busy, I am sure these accusations would fall
to the ground and truth would prevail; but he is obliged to trust
to others. This poor man is unable to defend himself because they
say his premises are against His Holiness. If he had to contend with
them only without the authority of the Pope to back them I am sure he
would soon silence them. It is his misfortune to have to submit to the
judgment of ignorant and malicious men who use the Pope as a shield.
I have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</span> already told you that I believe all this is done with the
intent to drive him to despair and cause him to lose his head so that
eventually he should turn against the Pope; for believe me, Giovanni,
he is one who could commit either great evil or great good. His life
and character demonstrate this. If they drive him into another path I
shall lose little, as I know that wherever he may be he will always
bear me goodwill because of my great affection for him. I have never
been able to make you understand this; and without entering into
details, which I cannot do, I must tell you he has been sorely tempted
by something which might raise a great scandal, and I have always
stopped him. Latterly he has been leading a saintly life here, and his
mind is at rest. These devils with their persecutions will tempt him.
People place far too much faith in them. In short I can only grieve
over all this and beg you again to use all your cleverness in order to
arrange matters, for you have no idea how it vexes and irritates me.

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">My illustrious Lord</span>,—I have received a letter from Your
Seigneury by the same hand that takes this, and am extremely concerned
at the displeasure you express about the last account sent in by
Cosimo Saxetti [Sassetti, head of the Medici bank at Lyons] to Your
Seigneury. It would afflict me still more if I thought that this
might cause you to doubt my gratitude towards Your Seigneury, to
whom I am so much beholden in infinite ways, that I should indeed
deserve to be called a most ungrateful man if I did not repay you
the money I owe for the many benefits received from Your Seigneury
in adversity and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</span> in prosperity. But after a strict examination of
my conscience I can assure Your Seigneury that neither I nor any of
my house will ever forget this. If therefore anything Cosimo Saxetti
has said about Your Seigneury’s participation has given such an
impression I should be deeply grieved, as it would be the reverse
of the truth and of my intentions. I confess that for some time, as
Your Seigneury well knows, the losses of our bank at Lyons have been
so considerable that it has been impossible to conceal them, or to
avoid lamenting over them with those who, like Your Seigneury, have
been and are masters of what is mine. The aforesaid Cosimo has thus
perhaps annoyed Your Seigneury, but you may be certain that I would
never raise any question as to a statement of yours, either what you
now write or at any future time. Your Seigneury can freely dispose not
only of the entire sum which you mention as being a matter of dispute
between Your Seigneury and Cosimo, but of everything I possess as
though it belonged to you. You may therefore rest assured that all
will be arranged between Your Seigneury and myself so satisfactorily
that no question will ever arise, for I set greater store on the good
graces of Your Seigneury than on the largest sum of money in the
world.—December 11, 1489.<a id="FNanchor_381" href="#Footnote_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a></p>

<p>The following letter from Vettori, Florentine ambassador at Naples, and
the one from Lorenzo to Lanfredini at Rome (p. <a href="#Page_319">319</a>) show what prudence
and patience the Magnificent exercised in mediating between the Pope
and the King of Naples. Ferrante broke every obligation of his treaty
with Innocent. He exterminated the rebel Barons with ferocity, he
murdered the Papal governor and garrison of Aquila, he bestowed the
Neapolitan benefices on unworthy men without heeding the remonstrances
of the Pope, he repudiated the tribute due to the Holy See. Innocent
was very angry. He declared the Kingdom to be forfeited for non-payment
of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</span> tribute, he threatened an interdict and, what particularly
alarmed and displeased Lorenzo, talked about foreign intervention.
Against both Lorenzo warned him, at the same time supporting him in
resisting humiliating terms. Had Lodovico Sforza been trustworthy
Lorenzo’s task might have been easier, but he significantly remarks,
“I have expressed my opinion of the Lord Lodovico and have said what
I think of him.” At length, shortly before Lorenzo’s death, peace was
concluded, Ferrante consenting to pay the tribute on condition of the
investiture of his son and grandson.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Pietro Vettori</span>, <i>Florentine Ambassador at Naples, to</i>
<span class="smcap">Lorenzo de’ Medici</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Magnificent Lorenzo</span>,—Since I wrote on the 2nd I have
received yours of February 29th, which arrived most opportunely
as here they were anxious, and suspected you had some secret
understanding with the Pope. As the King was not here I thought
it better to communicate your letter to H.E. the Duke [Alfonso of
Calabria]. So yesterday I went to Castel Nuovo and took Baccio with
me, who had been summoned here by the Duke. When he had read the
letter I added that though you knew the King and H.E. were convinced
of the loyalty of ourselves and of our city, yet it seemed to me that
as these suspicions had arisen you wished to set matters right, and
that you were the same Lorenzo you had ever been. H.E. answered he
had no doubt of this. That he had summoned Baccio in order to send
him to you at Florence to inform you of his feelings, as he liked to
speak openly and desired others to do so to him. That it was perfectly
known all over Italy what influence you had with the Pope and that
the Florentine ambassador <i>quodammodo</i> governed at Rome. On the
other hand the Pope showed great animosity towards the Neapolitan
State and had only summoned those Spanish ambassadors in order to
protest against H.M. the King and then to publish the excommunications
which were already ready. H.E. is informed that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</span> last year and also
two years ago everything was being secretly prepared for this last
blow. He appears to have some other source of information than the
usual ones. He added that his chief occupation now was contradicting
those who by word of mouth or by letters from Rome told him that
you are in league with the Pope, and allow these things to happen,
and that although neither he nor the King believe this all Italy is
convinced of it, to their great detriment. The Pope’s behaviour shows
that he is of the same opinion, for if he thought that Milan and
ourselves were what we ought to be he would never attempt anything
against this State. But one wounds him here, another caresses him
there, and between them all we, exclaimed H.E., go to the devil. He
said he would like to meet you and the Lord Lodovico in one room
and discuss matters, and did not think it would be difficult to
convince you that this our League must be united not only in deeds
but in demonstrations. That it was evident the Pope did much for
you, he had for instance made your son a cardinal at an unheard-of
age, and therefore it was thought that if you insisted things would
go differently. He then added that neither he nor the King had heard
anything about the troop of Jacopo Conti or the Count’s dismissal,
though Jacopo had written to him about this a month ago. H.E. said
it seemed as if you suspected him, though he would do all to forward
your projects. I replied it was true that the Pope showed some regard
for you and had acceded to your wishes as to the Cardinalate and one
or two other matters, but that it was possible your influence did not
extend to the affairs of H.M. the King, because although you could
do much you could not do all. Also that Your Magnificence had been
informed that H.E. had greatly encouraged the Count not to give up
Monte Agutolo, which was a blow aimed at you; so that if he heeded not
your honour and interest, he would find others do the same. He had
not yet been told of the Count’s dismissal or about Jacopo’s troop,
because they were connected together, and it was impossible to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</span> write
until affairs were settled. Owing to the disgraceful conduct of the
Count about Monte Agutolo you and all our citizens had determined
to dismiss him, and had not informed H.M. the King or H.E., as they
thought pressure might be brought to bear on them to retain him and
they did not wish to say no to H.E. I added that as H.E. loved you
he ought to be pleased if the Pope showed you any favour, because
he might be sure that if you had to choose between them you would
leave the Pope and follow H.E. That he was to consult with H.M. the
King as to the particular thing they wanted and that I was sure you
would always be ready to do anything honourable, but they must not
make vague complaints. Lorenzo does nothing because perhaps Their
Excellencies do not know exactly what they really want, or he could
not do what they desired. But that I was certain that any just and
honourable service he could render H.M. and H.E. he would do it. H.E.
replied that he would consult with H.M., and give me an answer. I see
he wants our ambassador and the ambassador of Milan to tell the Pope
that they will not tolerate any measures being taken against the King.
Then he added that he had sent a competent man to Barbary to acquire
one or two horses fit for racing, in order to send them to you; <i>et
alia non occurrunt</i>. I commend myself to you, may God grant you
felicity.—Naples, March 9, 1489 (1490).<a id="FNanchor_382" href="#Footnote_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a></p>

Magnificent Signory Of Siena, to whom I am under such obligations that
if they do not obtain their desire great blame and dishonour will fall

undertaking one spares no effort to accomplish it with honour. For the
love of God deliver me from this annoyance, which is considerable, and
set the aforesaid Bastiano free according to their wish, for their
character is such that either good or great evil will result. I do
not think you will wait for another communication from me, delay will

<p>Two days ago I met by chance the Count della Mirandola riding in the
outskirts of Florence. He is living very quietly in a villa near
by, immersed in his studies. He desires at last to know what his
future is to be, for having obeyed His Holiness hitherto and being
decided to obey him implicitly in the future, he wishes to have some
indication that His Holiness accepts his obedience in the form of a
Brief, whereby the Pope acknowledges him as an obedient son and a
good Christian, which I believe him to be. Among other proofs of this
he has converted a young Jew who has been translating for him from
the Hebrew language, of which he is a perfect master, whom he has
persuaded to become a Christian. This is not the act of a heretic.
I much desire that for the honour of His Holiness and for my own
satisfaction this matter should be finished, and that the virtue and
goodness of the said Count Giovanni should have as great a weight
as the calumnies and suggestions of others. By nature he is devoted
to His Holiness and does not dwell on what is past. Once delivered
from this contumacy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</span> he will be the partisan and faithful servant of
His Holiness, who to my thinking will thereby gain much.—August 11,

<div class="blockquot">

<p>By your letter of the 13th I understand that the Pope has taken
umbrage at the note presented by you, so do not proceed further with
it. Anything that vexes His Sanctity annoys me, and I should be very
sorry if he thought that any act or word of mine was not dictated
by a desire for the good of His Holiness. You can assure him that
I am always his servant and shall ever be. If I advised moderation
in these proceedings against the King [of Naples] I only did so for
the aforesaid reasons. As I wrote the other day, it seems to me
necessary that His Holiness should decide on following one of three
paths: either enforce his will by war against the King, or come to
some agreement, or, if an honourable agreement is not possible, to
temporise and wait for better times. The first would be the most
honourable, but I conceive dangerous and very costly; indeed I do not
think it possible unless the Neapolitan dynasty is changed. For this,
according to my views, three things are necessary: either Venice or
Milan must be a party to the enterprise, or the new ruler must be
strong and well supplied with men and money, or the Holy Father must
prepare to assert himself without stint of money or other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</span> things, to
carry the thing through. It is indispensable that the Pope and the
new ruler, whoever he may be, should be stronger than the King alone,
supposing always that Venice adheres and would prevent Milan from
helping the King. If they were understood with the Neapolitan Barons,
or other such small folk, so much the better. I may be mistaken as to
the first proposition when I dissuaded His Holiness from following
it, but the state of things does not seem to me propitious. Perhaps
I am not enough versed in all the secrets and therefore see and
anticipate wrongly. His Holiness must have some promises or hopes, for
the choice lies between Spain and France. Spain does not appear to me
strong enough, particularly as regards money. What reliance is to be
placed on France, seeing the French nature, I know not. Supposing she
changed her nature I should agree with our Holy Father that it would
be the best solution, for there would be less danger in augmenting the
power of one of the house of Lorraine than of Spain, for the Duke of
Lorraine is not King of France and we see by experience that the King
of Naples is far more influenced by Spain than the Duke of Lorraine is
by France. It is true the Kings of Naples and Spain are not friends,
and that whoever is King of Naples would work for his own hand. For
all these reasons, although there may be others I do not understand,
I cannot advise the Pope to undertake such an enterprise now; and
in that case it is unwise to exasperate the King with citations and
other threats. Even were His Holiness fully prepared to go forward I
think he ought to avoid the slightest sign of ill-will, in order not
to incur any danger from what the King might say or do. This danger
seems to me to exist, therefore he would do better to dissimulate
and make secret preparations, than to show anger before being ready
to strike, which would only give an opportunity to others to make
ready and to attack. So for every reason in the first proposition I
do not think it wise to cite the King. As to the second I may also be
mistaken, because conditions may have been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</span> proposed of which I am not
aware, and which may be rendered feasible by this very citation, if
the affair is matured and almost settled. In this case the assumption
of superiority may help to decide matters. But if there is nothing
more than I know the affair seems embittered and not at all easy of
solution; therefore such methods might lead to a scandal or even
to an open rupture, instead of to an agreement. The advantages of
temporising cannot, I think, be denied. There can be no doubt that
it is better to arrange matters, having due regard to the reputation
of His Holiness, than to tempt fortune; for you know better than I
do that the King can do much harm. But, as I said before, I do not
know enough about these matters so cannot say more. If the Pope has
good reasons for his fearless attitude let me know them to relieve my
mind, for though not of a timid nature I am far more anxious about
his affairs than about my own, because of the trust he reposes in
me. If His Holiness is satisfied, I have such faith in his prudence
and authority that I shall be tranquillised. But until I hear these
reasons I confess that I am uneasy. For the love of God let me know,
as I do not feel at all well. The Pope must not on any account imagine
that I think, do, or act, in any way against his interests, for the
benefits I have received from His Holiness, and those I hope for,
derive from his power and reputation. My opinion of the Lord Lodovico
I have expressed, and have said what I thought of him. My intentions
are loyal, and as I depend much on His Holiness I can only repeat that
if he can come to an honourable understanding with the King it would
be, I consider, better than war. If there is any difficulty about
this I would do my utmost to arrange matters to the Pope’s honour and
security; supposing always that the above-mentioned conditions, of
which I know nothing, and which would make it possible to act against
the King, are non-existent. If they do exist I am sure the King would
consent to honourable terms because he would understand what evil
might befall him otherwise. But all my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</span> suppositions are useless if
the Pope has secret information unknown to me. I do not think my
open speaking can offend His Holiness, for our fortunes are bound
up together. I wish to be allowed to say what I think, but will act
according to the wishes of our Holy Father. Thank him most heartily
for the loving and kindly reply about the Servite Order with regard
to Messer Giovanni. For all these things I am deeply indebted to His
Holiness. I am very glad you have been to Cervetri and S. Severa, and
most pleased that you were satisfied with the way Signor Francesco
(Cibò) treats his subjects. God knows his honour and well-being are
as dear to me as my own. I beg of you to do all you can to induce our
Holy Father to arrange this affair of S. Severa. You see yourself
the importance and the necessity of adding this property to that of
Cervetri. I should also like to know about the affair of Gallese in
order to reply to the friend who is coming here soon. It is urgent
that His Holiness should once for all arrange the affairs of Signor
Francesco so that I should not be daily worried about them, and that
we can live in peace and harmony. To speak plainly, Signor Francesco
has not the position the nephew of a Pope ought to have, and yet we
are now approaching the seventh year of the Pontificate. More regard
should be shown to the increasing family, which is a valid reason for
our Holy Father’s aid.—Florence, October 17, 1489.<a id="FNanchor_387" href="#Footnote_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Magnificent Patron</span>,—My last letter was from Ferrara. In
Padua I found some good books, <i>i.e.</i> Simplicio, on the Sky;
Alessandro, on the Topica; Giovan Grammatico, on the Posteriora
and the Syllogism; a David on Aristotle; none of which we have in
Florence. I also found a Greek scribe in Padua and arranged with him
at a ducat for every fifteen pages.</p>

<p>Maestro Piero Leoni showed me his books: among them I found M. Manlio,
an old astronomer and poet, which I have brought with me to Venice to
compare with one I have bought; I have never seen a more ancient book.
<i>Similiter</i> he possesses certain books of Galieno <i>de dogmate
Aristotelis et Hippocratis</i> in Greek, of which he will give us a
copy in Padua, so we shall have gained something.</p>

<p>In Venice I have found some books of Archimedes and Eron,
mathematicians, which we have not got, and a Frunuto <i>de Deis</i>,
and other valuable things. So papa Janni<a id="FNanchor_389" href="#Footnote_389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a> will have writing enough
to do for some time.</p>

<p>Niceno’s [Cardinal] library we were not able to see. Messer
<a id="aldovrandini"></a>Aldovrandini, the Duke of Ferrara’s ambassador, <i>in cujus domo<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</span>
habitamus</i>, went to the Prince but was met with a blunt refusal.
He asked for Count Giovanni [Pico della Mirandola], not for me, as
I thought it better not to mention your name in the affair. Messer
Antonio Vinciguerra and Messer Antonio Pizamanno, one of the two
philosophers who came incognito to Florence to see the Count, and a
brother of Messer Zaccheria Barbaro, are engaged in trying to overcome
this obstinacy; everything possible will be tried. This is all I have
to say about books.</p>

<p>Messer Piero Leoni has been greatly persecuted in Padua and has no
patients either there or in Venice. Yet he is a good doctor and held
in high esteem. I have caused him to be sounded by the Count as to
coming to Tuscany, but I think it will be difficult. He does not like
Padua and the society does not please him, <i>ut ipse ait; negut tamen
se elle in Thusciam agere</i>.</p>

<p>Nicoletto would come to Pisa but wants a benefice, <i>hoc est</i> one
of those canonries. His name stands high in Padua and his method is
good; but, <i>nisi fallor</i>, he is one of these odd fantastical men.
He it was who mentioned the benefice to me; so I warn you.</p>

<p>This morning I paid a visit to Messer Zaccheria Barbaro and assured
him of your affection &amp;c.; he replied tearfully <i>et ut visum est</i>
from his heart: all resolved itself into <i>in te uno spem esse</i>.
<i>Ostendit se nosse quantum tibi debeat</i>: so do what you intended,
<i>ut favens ad majora</i>. The Legate, who has returned from Rome,
<i>et qui tecum locutus est Florentiæ</i>, is not at all of their way
of thinking, <i>ut ajunt</i>.</p>

<p>Messer Zaccheria showed me a very beautiful antique earthen vase which
was sent to him lately from Greece, and told me that if I thought you
would like it he would send it to you with two smaller ones. I said it
was just what Your Magnificence would admire <i>et tandem</i> it will
be yours. To-morrow morning the box shall be made and I will send it
off. I do not think you have so fine a one <i>in eo genere</i>: it is
about three spans high and four wide.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</span></p>

<p>The Count [Pico della Mirandola] has bad eyes and has not been out of
the house since he came to Venice.</p>

<p><i>Item</i> yester evening I paid a visit to the learned Cassandra
Fidele and greeted her in your name. She is no less wonderful,
Lorenzo, in the vulgar tongue than in Latin; most discreet, <i>et meis
oculis etiam</i> handsome. I came away astounded. To you she is most
partial and talked about you with such understanding <i>quasi te intus
et in cute norit</i>. One of these days she intends to go to Florence
to see you, so prepare to do her honour.</p>

<p>I have no more to say at present, save that your causing Greek books
to be copied and the favour you show to learned men sets you higher in
the esteem and honour of the world than any man has enjoyed for many
years. Other particulars I reserve for my return. I commend myself to
Your Magnificence. I have not yet used the letter of exchange as I
have had no need of it.—Venice, June 20, 1491.</p>

<p>Monsignor d’Arles told me yesterday morning that the Signoria of
Venice and all the Venetian gentlemen are very irate with us for
two things. First because, according to them, we tried through the
Soldan to prevent that journey of theirs. Secondly on account of the
agreement about wool from England, which they have so much at heart
that they could not be more angry and are decided to upset it at
any cost. They have ordered that all ships carrying wool to Pisa,
no matter to whom they belong, are to be prevented from loading in
Candia, Cyprus, or any other place where they have ports, and that no
ship of theirs is to touch at Porto Pisano. I do not know<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</span> whether it
would be good to inform Tommaso Portinari so that he might tell the
King of England and explain to him the harm this decision will do to
H.M. and to his subjects, and that the Venetians want to be masters
and dictate laws to them.</p>

<p>Maestro Leoni was here this morning and tells me he is engaged at
Padua for two years certain and one year optional, at 2000 golden
pieces yearly; and he has accepted with the intention, if he is not
prevented, of practising medicine at Venice. He has taken this step
deliberately and left Pisa with this intent, but has been idle for
some time for his own justification. At Pisa he thought he was not
well treated by the authorities and told me much about it, and that he
was not regarded with the consideration he considers he had a right
to expect. You he praises highly and says that he perceives that
whatever good he experienced was solely through your influence and not
on account of his own merits. He intends to show what learning and
capabilities he possesses and to leave a name behind him. Wherever he
may be he affirms that he is ever yours.—July 1491.<a id="FNanchor_391" href="#Footnote_391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a></p>

<p>I have heard what has been ordered to Your Magnificence as to the
water and what the effect has been. First I must make an examination
and Your Magnificence will cease taking it. It will be better not
to wait until winter begins to lay in the usual provision, and Your
Magnificence can take first Morba for a week and then Villa for
another week. The less interval there is between the two the better.
During this time I will make a trial of the said water which has
arrived here in safety. I have not been able to do so on account of
being occupied with lectures until the first August: then I had to go
to Venice to pay my duty to the Doge and the Signoria. As<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</span> soon as I
have settled the Venetian business I shall make a trial at Padua of
that water for a purpose of my own, for I need it, and according to
the effect obtained I shall see whether we have something different
from <i>arzente</i><a id="FNanchor_392" href="#Footnote_392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a> water; if I find it is different, as I think,
when I have tried it, I will see how to make it suit the case of Your
Magnificence. If it be <i>arzente</i> water, we shall have unmasked
it, which will not be at all unpleasing to me. Your Magnificence can
take the Morba water without further advice, except when the wind is
northerly, for then it is of little or no use. Let us hope the weather
will soon be fine again and then Your Magnificence is to ride fast
and far after drinking the water when fasting, morning and evening.
Beware of cold and damp feet, of moonlight, and of the air at sunset,
and do not eat pears or swallow grape pips. I received Proculus, which
has given me the more pleasure that I have long wished to possess it,
and finding that it is as excellent as I supposed I shall have it
translated. When finished I will do as Your Magnificence says. I have
heard that Lascari found in Calabria a commentary by Proculus on the
Heraclitus of Plato. I beg Your Magnificence, when you know where this
commentary is, to try and get it, or to tell me so that I may try. It
must be valuable because the matter in itself is good and the author
is the most competent man there is in such things. No more at present.

<p><span class="smcap">Matteo Franco</span> <i>at Rome to</i> <span class="smcap">Ser Piero Dovizi</span>
<i>at Florence</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Ser Piero, you know how long ago I told you of the want of order in
this house and how things went from bad to worse<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</span> so that I gave up
fighting; and how a Florentine was like a Cross among devils. Also
I informed you of Madonna’s [Maddalena] tribulations with regard to
divers matters. But as I suspect you never read my letters to the
end, probably these things will be new to you. With this doubt and
also as a satisfaction to myself, I write, for I am bursting with
pent-up rage, and know not where to turn for advice or help. When I
see such coldness and want of care and affection for persons of far
more importance than Franco, I cease to trouble about my own affairs,
but about theirs I am in despair. No one, man or woman, ever comes to
this house, save once in a blue moon, to ask whether Madonna is alive
or dead. Let be that they grant her no authority, but they might ask
if she is alive. Ever since our return she has been shut up in the
house, save the two days spent at Cervetri, twice that she went to see
the Pope, and one evening when she supped at the bank. She is always
ailing and there does not seem to be a man living who takes interest
in her. Cursed be that milk-cheese, those curds, those pears, that
flask of trebbiano, that bundle of fennel and those medlars, that have
never, never been sent to her by you or by anybody. These Genoese with
the Pope have the most beautiful loggia and all the greatest marvels
of the world, let alone other things of more value. While she, poor
patient child, the daughter of such a man and so perfect and charming
in herself, is less esteemed than would be the daughter of an exile,
and as I well know there are always prevarications, excuses and
justifications, saying that notice must not be taken of small things
and that one day all of a sudden we shall hear the thunder and see
the lightning of some important event. We shall see, my Ser Piero,
but I have no faith in excuses, and the conclusion is that if you do
not help to keep this house things you do not expect will happen, for
which you will be sorry.</p>

<p>I have written all this, full of despair and anger, to others besides
yourself. The bad health of Madonna Maddalena and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</span> the thoughtless
behaviour of my Lord in keeping her up, for all this winter he has
gambled every night, supping at six or seven and coming to bed at
daylight, and she will not, and cannot, eat or sleep without him.
Thus she has lost sleep and appetite and has become as thin as a
lizard, as I told you. To the ambassador and Noferi and Ser Niccolò
and to Christ, I have told this every day and kept them informed. The
ambassador replies: “It is your business to write to Lorenzo, what can
I do in the matter? Write, and let me act.” And Noferi says: “I fear
this girl will not live long, and my Lord says and does &amp;c., and they
ought to be warned at Florence, &amp;c.” Ser Niccolò, whom I asked about
either summoning Maestro Piero Leoni or describing her symptoms to him
and sending him the prescriptions of the doctors here, for the girl
has great faith in Maestro Leoni as he treated her mother and herself
and knows her constitution, made me copy out all the recipes of the
doctors and said it would be well to write and that he would do so.
Then he got immersed in grand doings and all has come to nought. Poor
Franco runs here and runs there angered inside and out, and his heart
is bursting. The worst is that he has not enough authority or brains
to set things right.</p>

<p>Madonna’s illness is caused by sitting up too late at night, eating at
hours she is not used to, and remaining shut up in the house all day
without taking any exercise; then, like her mother, she is melancholy,
thin, and pensive, and takes every caprice and folly of her husband’s
to heart. She thinks and dreams of nought else, so great is her love
of him. She is slowly pining away and this seems to me the most
alarming symptom, for nothing she eats or drinks does her any good or
gives her any pleasure....</p>

<p>Ser Piero, I beg you as earnestly as I can to excuse me and with
clasped hands I entreat you to get me away from here. First because,
as I have told you several times, I cannot bear it any longer, and
then because I get small honour and less gain.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</span> I know what I say.
Madonna can do little for me and I can do even less for her in the
state to which they have reduced her. I always told you none but a
Franco would have endured this life. No more at present. Let us study
to find a remedy for what is more important, and see that this girl
should be served rather like the daughter of her father than the wife
of him she has married. Let the rest go as it will. I commend myself
to you.—Rome, January 16, 1492.</p>

<p>Lorenzo’s end was fast approaching. The following extracts from
Manfredi’s letters show how terribly he suffered, and with what
fortitude he bore extreme pain. From his last words to Filippo Valori
and Andrea Cambini, who accompanied the young Cardinal Giovanni to
Rome, “I entrust the youth of my son to you, you will not see me
again,” it is evident he knew death was near. But in the long letter to
his son at Rome he makes no allusion to his own health, as though he
did not wish to cloud the lad’s first entrance into life. It is full
of political wisdom, knowledge of the world, and fatherly foresight.
After Giovanni’s departure Lorenzo rallied a little, and on March 21st
was carried to Careggi, attended by his favourite sister Bianca, his
daughter Lucrezia, his eldest son Piero, and the faithful Poliziano.</p>

<p>I have nought to report to Your Excellency save that yesterday the
Most Rev. Cardinal de’ Medici [Giovanni, Lorenzo’s second son] left
for Rome. Last Saturday he received the hat in a certain abbey, called
the Abbey of Fiesole, and then in his Cardinal’s robes, accompanied
by us ambassadors, many bishops, and a large number of citizens, made
a triumphal entry into the city. Dismounting at the palace of the
Signoria he paid them a visit. He mounted again and we accompanied him
to his father’s house. Next day, with the same following he went to S.
Liberata [the cathedral] to hear mass, which was celebrated by eight
bishops with great solemnity, and at which the Illustrious Signoria
assisted. At the close the Cardinal took leave of the Signoria in
the church and accompanied by us went to his father’s house where a
magnificent banquet was prepared, at which we ambassadors assisted
(having been previously invited) and sixty of the principal citizens
of this State. The house was most richly adorned. Before we rose from
table a great number of chiselled silver vases were presented to the
Cardinal on behalf of the Signoria. A stupendous sight, for the vases
were large and well ornamented. They were valued at 10,000 ducats or
more, which may well be, as they weighed more than 1000 pounds. We
ambassadors then went with His Illustrious Reverence to his room and
rich and handsome silver vases were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</span> brought by the various Communes,
and the Jews of the city, but His Lordship would not accept them and
gave them back to the donors with fair words of thanks. Likewise
he accepted nothing from any citizen save from his relations, who
gave him splendid gifts. The Magnificent Lorenzo, though in pain,
came into the hall where we were dining to see the Cardinal and us
ambassadors, and has begun to ride again, although often seized with
pain....—Florence, March 13, 1492.<a id="FNanchor_399" href="#Footnote_399" class="fnanchor">[399]</a></p>

Giovanni</span>, <i>at Rome, in March 1492</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Messer Giovanni</span>,—You are much beholden to our Lord God,
as we all are for your sake, as besides many benefits and honours
our house has received from Him it has pleased Him to bestow on you
the highest dignity our family has yet enjoyed. Great as this is it
is much enhanced by circumstances, particularly your youth and our
condition. Therefore my first recommendation is that you endeavour
to be grateful to our Lord God, remembering every hour that it is
not by your own merits or solicitude that you have attained the
Cardinalate, but by the grace of God. Show your gratitude to Him by
leading a saintly, exemplary, and honest life. You are the more bound
to do this because during your youth you have shown a disposition
which gives hope of good fruit. It would be indeed most shameful,
contrary to your duty, and to my expectations if at a time when
others generally acquire more reason and a better understanding of
life, you should forget the good precepts learned as a boy. It is
incumbent on you to try and lighten the burden of the dignity you
have attained by leading a pure life and persevering in the studies
suitable to your profession. I was greatly pleased last year to learn
that without being reminded by any one you had been several times<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</span> to
confession and to communion, for I conceive there is no better way of
obtaining the grace of God than by habituating oneself to persevere
in these duties. This seems to me the best advice I can begin with.
I know, as you are now going to Rome, that sink of all iniquities,
that you will find some difficulty in following it, as bad examples
are always catching, and inciters to vice will not be wanting. Your
promotion to the Cardinalate, as you may imagine, at your age and for
the other reasons already mentioned, will be viewed with great envy,
and those who were not able to prevent your attaining this dignity
will endeavour, little by little, to diminish it by lowering you in
public estimation and causing you to slide into the same ditch into
which they have themselves fallen, counting on success because of
your youth. You must be all the firmer in your stand against these
difficulties, as at present one sees such a lack of virtue in the
College. I recollect however to have known a good many learned and
good men in the College, leading exemplary lives. It will be well
that you should follow their example, for by so doing you will be the
more known and esteemed as being different from the others. It is
imperative above all things that you should avoid as you would Scylla
and Charybdis the reputation of being a hypocrite and of evil fame.
Be not ostentatious, and have a care to avoid anything offensive in
conduct and in conversation, without affecting austerity or severity.
These are things you will in time understand and practise better,
I conceive, than I can write them. You know how important is the
position and the example of a Cardinal, and that the world would be
far better if the Cardinals were what they ought to be, for then
there would always be a good Pope, from whom emanates, one may say,
peace for all Christians. Make every effort therefore to be this, if
others had done so we might hope for universal good. Nothing is more
difficult than to hold converse with men of various characters, and
in this I can ill advise you; only recollect when with the Cardinals
and other men of rank to try and be charitable and respectful in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</span> your
conversation, weighing your reasons well without being influenced by
the passions of others; for many desiring what they cannot attain turn
reason into abuse. Satisfy your conscience therefore by taking care
that your conversation with every man should be devoid of offence.
This seems to me a general rule most applicable in your case, for
should passion by chance make an enemy, as his enmity would have no
reasonable cause he may sometimes return with more ease to the old
friendship. It will be better I think on this, your first visit to
Rome, to use your ears more than your tongue. To-day I have given you
entirely to our Lord God and to Holy Church; it is therefore essential
that you become a good ecclesiastic, cherishing the honour and the
State of Holy Church and of the Apostolic See above aught else in
this world, and devoting yourself entirely to their interests. While
doing this it will not be difficult for you to aid the city and our
house, for the city being united to the Church you will represent
the solid chain, and our house is part of the city. Although it is
impossible to foresee what may happen I think it is likely that a way
will be found to save, as the proverb says, the goat and the cabbages,
always keeping steadfastly to your above-mentioned duty of setting the
interests of the Church above all else. You are the youngest Cardinal,
not only of the College, but the youngest that has hitherto been made,
it is therefore most necessary that where you have to compete with
the others you should be the most eager and the humblest, and avoid
making others wait for you in Chapel, in Consistory, or in Deputation.
You will soon learn who has a good or an evil reputation. With the
latter avoid any great intimacy, not only on your own account, but
for the sake of public opinion; converse in a general way with all.
I advise you on feast-days to be rather below than above moderation,
and would rather see a well-appointed stable and a well-ordered and
cleanly household than magnificence and pomp. Let your life be regular
and reduce your expenses gradually in the future, for the retinue and
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</span> master being both new at first it will be difficult. Jewels and
silken stuffs must be used sparingly by one in your position. Rather
have a few good antiques and fine books, and well-bred and learned
attendants, than many of them. Ask people to your own house oftener
than you accept invitations to theirs, but do both sparingly. Eat
plain food and take much exercise, for those who wear your habit, if
not careful, easily contract maladies. The rank of Cardinal is as
secure as it is great, men therefore often become negligent; they
conceive they have done enough and that without exertion they can
preserve their position. This is often prejudicial to character and
to life, and a thing against which you must guard; rather trust too
little than too much in others. One rule I recommend to you above all
others, and that is to get up betimes; besides being good for health
one can meditate over and arrange all the business of the following
day, and in your position, having to say the office, to study, to give
audiences &amp;c. you will find it most useful. Another thing absolutely
necessary to one in your station is to reflect, particularly at this,
the commencement of your career, in the evening on all you have to do
next day, so that an unforeseen event may not come upon you unawares.
As to speaking in the Consistory, I think it would be more seemly
and becoming if you refer all that comes before you to His Holiness,
alleging that as you are young and inexperienced you consider it
your duty to submit everything to the most learned judgment of His
Holiness. You will probably be asked to intercede in various matters
with our Holy Father. Be cautious however at the beginning to ask as
few favours as possible and not to bother him; the disposition of
the Pope is to be grateful to those who do not break his ears. Bear
this in mind in order not to annoy him. When you see him, talk about
amusing things, and if you have to beg, do it with all humility and
modesty. This will please him and be in accordance with his nature.
Keep well.—Florence.<a id="FNanchor_400" href="#Footnote_400" class="fnanchor">[400]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Salvus sis</i>,—In case ...<a id="FNanchor_401" href="#Footnote_401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a> (I) did not tell you of some
things. On Friday morning I was given a public reception and went
accompanied by all the Cardinals, nearly the whole court, and very
heavy rain, from S.M. del Popolo to the palace and from the palace to
Campo di Fiore. Our Holy Father received me most graciously: I hardly
spoke to him. The following day the ambassadors waited on our Holy
Father; their audience was most satisfactory. The Pope desired to hear
me the day after, which is to-day. I have been, and His Holiness spoke
as lovingly as was possible to me, and reminded me, and advised me, to
do something when I visited these Cardinals, and I have begun to do so
with those to whom as yet I have paid visits. Another time I will tell
you who they are. All professed the greatest goodwill towards you. Of
former things I know that you have been told. Of myself I have nought
to say save that I will try hard to do you honour. <i>De me proloqui
ulterius, nefas.</i> The news that you are so much better has been a
great joy to me and I have no other wish than to hear this often. For
this I send thanks to Ser Piero [Leoni, the doctor]. I commend myself
to you. No more at present.—Rome, March 25, 1492.</p>

<p>In a letter to Jacopo Antiquario, Poliziano describes the malady from
which Lorenzo had been suffering and then continues:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>... The day before his death, being at his villa of Careggi, he grew
so weak that all hope of his recovery vanished.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</span> Perceiving this,
like a wise man he called for the confessor to purge himself of past
sins. This same confessor told me afterwards that he marvelled to see
with what courage and constancy Lorenzo prepared himself for death;
how well he ordered all things pertaining thereunto, and with what
faith and religious feeling he reflected on the world to come. Towards
midnight while he was quietly meditating he was informed that the
priest bearing the Holy Sacrament had arrived. Rousing himself he
exclaimed, “It shall never be said that my Lord who created and saved
me shall come to me—in my room—raise me, I beg of you, raise me
quickly so that I may go and meet Him.” Saying this he raised himself
as well as he could and, supported by his servants, advanced to meet
the priest in the outer room. There crying he knelt down.</p>
</div>

<p>Poliziano gives a long prayer recited by Lorenzo and then continues:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>These and other things he said sobbing, while all around cried
bitterly. At length the priest ordered that he should be raised from
the ground and carried to his bed, in order to receive the Viaticum in
more comfort. For some time he resisted, but at last out of respect
for the priest he consented. In bed repeating almost the same prayer,
with much gravity and devotion he received the body and blood of
Christ. Then he devoted himself to consoling his son Piero, for the
others were not there, and exhorted him to bear this law of necessity
with courage, feeling sure that the aid of Heaven would be vouchsafed
to him, as it had been to himself in many and divers occasions, if
he only acted wisely. Meanwhile your Lazarus, the doctor from Pavia,
arrived, most learned as it seemed to me, but summoned too late to be
of any use. Yet to do something he ordered various precious stones to
be pounded together in a mortar for I know not what kind of medicine.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</span>
Lorenzo thereupon asked the servants what the doctor was doing in
his room and what he was preparing, and when I answered that he was
composing a remedy to comfort his intestines he recognised my voice,
and looking kindly as is his wont: “Oh Angiolo,” he said, “art thou
here?” and raising his languid arms took both my hands and pressed
them tightly. I could not stifle my sobs or stay my tears though I
tried to hide them by turning my face away. But he showed no emotion
and continued to press my hands between his. When he saw that I could
not speak for crying, quite naturally he loosened my hands, and I ran
into the adjoining room where I could give free vent to my grief and
to my tears. Then drying my eyes I returned, and as soon as he saw me
he called me to him and asked what Pico della Mirandola was doing. I
replied that Pico had remained in town fearing to molest him with his
presence. “And I,” said Lorenzo, “but for the fear that the journey
here might be irksome to him would be most glad to see him and speak
to him for the last time before I leave you all.” I asked if I should
send for him. “Certainly, and with all speed,” answered he. This I
did, and Pico came and sat by the bed, whilst I leaned against his
knees in order to hear the languid voice of my lord for the last time.
With what goodness, with what courtesy, I may say with what caresses,
Lorenzo received him. First he asked his pardon for thus disturbing
him, begging him to regard it as a sign of the friendship—the
love—he bore him, assuring him that he died more willingly after
seeing so dear a friend. Then introducing, as was his wont, pleasant
and familiar sayings, he joked also with us. “I wish,” he said to
Pico, “that death had spared me until your library had been complete.”
Pico had hardly left the room when Fra Girolamo [Savonarola] of
Ferrara, a man celebrated for his doctrine and his sanctity and an
excellent preacher, came in. To his exhortations to remain firm in his
faith and to live in future, if God granted him life, free from crime,
or if God so willed it to receive death willingly, Lorenzo<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</span> answered
that he was firm in his religion, that his life would always be guided
by it, and that nothing could be sweeter to him than death, if such
was the divine will. Fra Girolamo then turned to go when Lorenzo said:
“Oh Father, before going deign to give me thy benediction.” Bowing
his head, immersed in piety and religion he repeated the words and
the prayers of the friar, without paying any attention to the grief
now openly shown of his attendants. It seemed that all, save Lorenzo,
were going to die, so calm was he. He gave no signs of anxiety or
of sorrow; even in that supreme moment he showed his usual strength
of mind and his fortitude. The doctors who stood round, not to seem
idle, worried him with their remedies and assistance. He submitted to
everything they suggested, not because he thought it would save him,
but in order not to offend any one, even in death. To the last he had
such mastery over himself that he joked about his own death. Thus
when given something to eat and asked how he liked it he replied: “As
well as a dying man can like anything.” He embraced us all tenderly
and humbly asked pardon if during his illness he had caused annoyance
to any one. Then disposing himself to receive extreme unction he
commended his soul to God. The Gospel containing the Passion of Christ
was then read and he showed that he understood by moving his lips, or
raising his languid eyes, or sometimes moving his fingers. Gazing upon
a silver crucifix inlaid with precious stones and kissing it from time
to time, he expired....—Fiesole, May 18, 1492.<a id="FNanchor_403" href="#Footnote_403" class="fnanchor">[403]</a></p>
</div>

<p>This is Poliziano’s account of the last hours of Lorenzo. The
authority for the following by Fra Pacifico Cinozzi, is Fra Silvestro,
the adherent of Savonarola who went to the stake with him, and who
professed to have heard it from the lips of his master. To say the
least it would be unusual for a dying man who had already confessed
and received the Viaticum to wish to make a second confession, and to
receive absolution from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</span> another priest. Again, had Savonarola left
Careggi as described by Fra Pacifico, Lorenzo’s body would hardly
have been carried to S. Marco before the funeral and the burial in S.
Lorenzo.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Now it pleased God that Lorenzo fell ill, and becoming worse and
nigh unto death he sent for the said Father Fra Ieronimo, using these
very words: ‘Go for the Father Fra Ieronimo, for I have never found
one save him who was an honest friar.’ Thus going to Careggi, where
Lorenzo was, he entered and after a few words Lorenzo said he desired
to make his confession. Fra Ieronimo answered he was willing, but
before hearing the confession he wished to mention three things, if
these were acceded to no doubt whatever his salvation was assured.
Lorenzo replied he was willing and would do what was asked. The Father
said: ‘Lorenzo, it is needful for you to have great faith,’ and he
answered: ‘Father, that I have.’ Fra Ieronimo then added the second:
‘Also it is needful that you restore what has been wrongfully taken.’
After reflecting for a while he answered: ‘Father, I will do so, or
I will cause my heirs to do it if I cannot.’ The Father then said:
‘It is needful for you to give back to the Republic the liberty of
the city, and to see that she returns to her ancient state.’ To these
words he gave no reply. Thus the said Father departed without further
confession, and not long after Lorenzo died. These words I heard from
Fra Silvestro who died together with Fra Ieronimo; and I believe he
knew and heard them from Father Fra Ieronimo.”<a id="FNanchor_404" href="#Footnote_404" class="fnanchor">[404]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Popular opinion in Florence at the time certainly seems to favour
Poliziano’s account. Bartolommeo Cerretani, who noted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</span> events carefully
in his chronicle, wrote on April 7, 1492: “About the fifth hour
Lorenzo received the Sacraments.” A few days later Benedetto Dei
wrote the following letter to his uncle, who was an adherent of the
Medici and often went to foreign lands on their commercial business.
Curious readers will find the discrepancies between the two narratives
discussed in Creighton’s <i>History of the Papacy</i>, Villari’s
<i>Life and Times of Savonarola</i>, and Horsburgh’s <i>Lorenzo the
Magnificent</i>.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Dearest Uncle</span>,—On Saturday last the 7th I wrote in answer to
your letter giving you full accounts of our private affairs, of the
house, and of everything, which I conclude you received. Giannotto
was too busy to write, and probably will not even have time to-day,
being so occupied with that business you know of; it is in danger in
consequence of the sad event of which you have heard. I did not write
to you before on account of the universal grief and tribulation, so
that not only writing but even thinking about it was difficult. It is
true that on Saturday I wrote you word that the Magnificent Lorenzo
was at Careggi for change of air, not well, and in pain it was said.
In the evening after my letter had gone it was reported that he had
a slight fainting fit, but no one was alarmed, chiefly because of
that accursed Maestro Piero Leoni of Spoleto, who to the very last
insisted that he could not die of that malady. On Saturday arrived the
doctor from Milan, who at once saw that he had been wrongly treated,
and prepared many remedies, but it was too late. He ought to have had
cold things and he was given hot. Finally on Sunday, after the fourth
hour of night, according to the will of Him who rules the world, he
quitted this life in the flower of his age, and most assuredly far too
soon, to the great and bitter sorrow of the whole city; and with every
reason, for no doubt we have lost the splendour not only of Tuscany
but of all Italy.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</span> Every day we shall learn more what we have lost. As
yet it cannot be calculated, but time will show.</p>

<p>The other terrible event is the insane death of Maestro Piero Leoni,
who when he saw his lying science had deceived him, which some say
was allied to necromancy, went out of his mind, and was taken to the
house of the Martelli near by, that is to say at S. Gervasio, where he
was well treated, and passed the night full of melancholy and without
speaking or answering any one. In the early morning he called for a
towel and washed his face at a well, and asked a peasant how deep the
water was. He was left leaning against the edge, and a short time
afterwards a woman went to draw water, and found him head downwards in
the well; half of his body was above water. She gave the alarm, and
then was seen the miserable end of a man of such erudition who had
used his science ill.</p>

<p>This created a great stir among the people who were already much
troubled by what had happened. But when it was proved that madness
alone had impelled the deed accusations made by idle tongues ceased,
and people said it served him right that he should have taken his own
life. There was no bruise or hurt on the handsome body, and to those
who saw, it was a sad spectacle. For a day it lay there by the well,
and was then buried in a field like those who elect to die thus.</p>

<p>On Monday evening at one of the clock [an hour after sundown] the body
of Lorenzo was borne by the Company of the Magi into the sacristy of
S. Lorenzo in the coffin wherein it had been brought from Careggi the
night before, with many torches and tapers. The next day, that is
Tuesday, the 10th, the funeral took place without much pomp, as had
always been the custom of their ancestors, without banners. There were
but three Orders of friars and one of priests; in truth, great pomp
could not be shown, for the greatest splendour would have been small
for such a man. But wonderful was the number of citizens and nobles,
in long black robes touching the ground, who came to do him honour;
it was a fine spectacle,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</span> and touching to see such manifest signs of
sadness and of sorrow.</p>

<p>The visits to Piero have been many of the whole city, and by common
accord all agree in maintaining him in the position of his father.
As a commencement a motion was carried by acclamation in the Council
which is to be published on Monday, declaring that Piero is to be one
of the Seventy in his father’s place, and is eligible for all offices,
the Council of Eight, the Twelve procurators, the Accopiatori, the
Operai of the Palace, and so on, which the Magnificent Lorenzo filled
or might have filled, and this notwithstanding his being under age. It
was a great thing and carried unanimously, and all united together to
do him honour with the hope that he will be a worthy heir of all his
father’s virtues.</p>

<p>Lorenzo lived forty-three years three months and six days, having been
born on January 2, 1448.<a id="FNanchor_405" href="#Footnote_405" class="fnanchor">[405]</a> He died so nobly and with such patience,
understanding, and reverence towards God, as the most religious man
and divine soul could show; with such holy words on his lips that he
seemed another S. Jerome. God be merciful to him.—Florence, April 14,
1492. Your servant,</p>

<p>Lorenzo was buried by the side of his brother Giuliano under the
sarcophagus fashioned by Verrocchio for Cosimo and Piero in the Old
Sacristy of S. Lorenzo, but in 1559 the coffins were removed and
placed in a vault under the statue of the Madonna by Michelangelo in
the New Sacristy. No epitaph, not even his name, marks the spot where
the Magnificent Lorenzo lies. King Ferrante’s words when he heard of
his death were prophetic: “This man has lived long enough for his own
immortal fame, but not for Italy. God grant that now he is dead men may
not attempt that which they dared not do while he was alive.”</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_161" href="#FNanchor_161" class="label">[161]</a> Agnolo Poliziano, born in 1454, was the son of Benedetto
de’ Cini, commonly called Ambrogini, a lawyer. He dropped his family
name and took that of Poliziano from his native town Montepulciano
(Mons Politianus). His father was murdered when he was a child of eight
and he was sent to Florence to live with an uncle, Cino di Mattei, a
poor man who lived near Piazza S. Spirito in Via Saturno. Poliziano
studied rhetoric under Cristofero, Landino, and Andronico, philosophy
under <a id="argyropoulos"></a>Argyropoulos and Marsilio Ficino, in the Florentine Studio from
his fifteenth to his twentieth year. Lorenzo de’ Medici, after reading
his translation of Homer, provided for his education, and he became
one of Lorenzo’s most intimate friends, tutor to his children and his
librarian. Poliziano took his degree as Doctor of Law, and entering the
Church was made a Canon of the cathedral of Florence. He wrote scholia
and notes to Ovid, Catullus, Statius, Suetonius, Pliny the Younger, and
the <i>Historicæ Augustæ</i>; translated the History of Herodian, the
Manuel of Epictetus, the Aphorisms of Hippocrates, some Dialogues of
Plato, and other works from Greek into Latin. His <i>Miscellanea</i>,
published in Florence in 1489, were arranged for the press at Lorenzo’s
request. Poliziano’s Italian poetry, particularly the <i>Stanze per
la Giostra</i>, or Tournament, of Giuliano de’ Medici is beautiful,
and his <i>Sylvæ</i>, odes, epigrams, and other short Latin poems
are celebrated. He also wrote <i>Panepistemon</i>, a category of the
various branches of knowledge, and when quite a lad the <i>Orfeo</i>,
one of the earliest Italian operas. So popular was the <i>Orfeo</i>
that it was printed either separately or with the <i>Stanze</i> twenty
times between 1494 and 1541, and thirteen times between 1541 and 1565.
For the use of the common people a redaction in octave stanzas was
published in Florence in 1558 called <i>La Historia e Favola d’Orfeo
alla dolce lira</i>. The last reprint was in 1860.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_172" href="#FNanchor_172" class="label">[172]</a> The <i>catasto</i> of 1427 was a register or list of
all who were bound to pay taxes to the Commune of Florence. It runs:
“1. Ten officials are to be appointed to compile the register. 2.
All families liable to be taxed are to be inscribed in four books;
their number, ages, health, capacity, and occupation. 3. All their
possessions, movable and immovable, are to be inscribed, whether
within the confines of the State or abroad, monies in existence, or
what is owing to them, their slaves and whatever belongs to them. 4.
In the same way other partial <i>catasti</i> shall be drawn up, as of
peasants, universities, and guilds, foreigners and other persons not
generally liable to be taxed. 5. The income of each separate possession
is to be noted, so that the capital value may be ascertained, and 100
florins shall be taken as the valuation for every 7 florins of income.
6. From such valuation shall be deducted the inherent expenses, rent of
houses, of shops, the price of horses for personal use, and 2 florins
per head. 7. The net income being thus reduced, 10 golden soldi are
to be paid on every 100 golden florins, equal to the tenth part of
a percentage at 5 per cent. 8. On every person deducted as above,
between eighteen years of age and sixty, an arbitrary tax shall be
imposed, not to exceed 2 florins. 9. It is left to the discretion of
the officials, in case no surplus remains after the above deductions,
to impose a tax to be arranged with the persons taxed. 10. Whoso
declares a false income shall have his possessions confiscated. 11.
Should any contention arise the decision of the officials is final;
they may not diminish the amount of the tax, save for the repayment of
a dower, until the new <i>catasto</i>, without the approbation of the
Great Council, but they may augment it. 12. The <i>catasto</i> is to
be corrected and compiled anew every three years. 13. All taxes are
henceforward to be regulated by the <i>catasto</i>.” <i>Osservatore
Fiorentino</i>, i. 91. Signor A. Rabbini, <i>Dell’ accertamento
catastale</i>, &amp;c., defines the <i>catasto</i> as at present existing
as “a public document serving as an absolutely legal and fundamental
base for the imposition of taxes on landed property and a guide in
judicial or administrative procedure involving the settlement of
questions regarding landed property and the rights and obligations of
the owners thereof.”</p>

June 18, 1472, came a horseman with the olive branch [from Volterra]
announcing the capitulation; the people and their property to be
respected. Great was the rejoicing. But when we entered the city one
of their officers, a Venetian, shouted “Pillage,” and our men began
to pillage and we could not stop them or observe the articles of
capitulation. The Count Federigo d’Urbino caused the Venetian and
a Sienese to be hung.” <i>Diario Fiorentino di Luca Landucci.</i>

<p><a id="Footnote_175" href="#FNanchor_175" class="label">[175]</a> Francesco Filelfo, born at Tolentino in 1398, was a
famous classical scholar. He studied at Padua, was sent as Secretary of
Legation to Constantinople by the Signoria of Venice, and afterwards
taught Greek in Venice, Bologna, Florence, &amp;c. When Cosimo de’ Medici
was imprisoned he urged the Signoria to put him to death and poured
out abominable accusations against him and his friends in the <i>Book
of Exile</i>. Poggio replied, accusing Filelfo of the most heinous
crimes, and the war of words went on for years. When Cosimo returned
to Florence Filelfo fled to Milan and allied himself with Albizzi
and the other exiles, but soon made abject advances to Cosimo, which
were treated with silent disdain. After Cosimo’s death he sent humble
letters to Lorenzo and his brother and wrote <i>Cosmias</i>, a poem
in praise of the man he had abused. Lorenzo at length allowed him to
return to Florence where he died in 1481. He was mean, arrogant, and
intensely vain.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_187" href="#FNanchor_187" class="label">[187]</a> Born in Florence of poor parents named della Badessa,
Matteo, as was often done in the fifteenth century, adopted his
father’s Christian name and became Matteo Franco. As a lad he entered
the church, and some of his first efforts in poetry are sonnets
addressed to the Archbishop of Florence begging in the name of S.
Peter for a cloak. He made friends with Angelo Poliziano who probably
introduced him to the Medici. Witty, clever, kind-hearted, Matteo soon
became indispensable to Lorenzo, who speaks of him as “among the first
and best-loved creatures of my house.” He repaid Lorenzo’s affection
tenfold by his devotion to his daughter Maddalena, whom he accompanied
to Rome when she married Francesco Cibo. Even Lorenzo’s wife Clarice,
always ill at ease among her husband’s brilliant friends and at first
suspicious of Matteo’s tongue, soon discovered his many excellent
qualities, and he became her treasurer, her almoner, and at length
her attorney. He taught all Lorenzo’s children to read, and in one
of his sonnets feelingly describes the trouble they gave him. Until
lately it was supposed that Luigi Pulci and Matteo Franco were really
friends, and only wrote the ferocious and biting sonnets which amused
all Florence to each other to amuse Lorenzo, but Signor Volpi proves, I
think, that their animosity was real and that Matteo often had the best
in the war of words.</p>

From there he wrote to the Pope expressing deep gratitude to the
Signoria and to Lorenzo de’ Medici for the kind treatment he had
received, and bitterly lamented that His Holiness had not acceded to
his prayer that the interdict should be taken off. On June 12th he left
for Siena, and an old chronicler writes that he was still under the
influence of great terror and seemed to feel the rope round his neck.
If at the time of the assassination he had not been well guarded the
exasperated populace would probably have torn him to pieces.</p>

opinion of Bartolommeo Sozzino (probably what Poliziano refers to),
Francesco Aretino, Lancillotto Decio, Bulgarino, Andrea Panormita,
Pier Filippo Cornio and other masters of canon law and theology, who

a godsend to Lorenzo that he was suspected of being in league with
the Turk. It forced the King of Naples to recall his son, the Duke of
Calabria, from Siena, where he had aided the nobles to overthrow the
popular government, and the Pope to cancel the interdict and make peace
with Florence. In November an embassy, with old Luigi Guicciardini at
its head, went to Rome and were solemnly reprimanded by Sixtus and then
blessed. The only condition he imposed was the equipment of fifteen
galleys to serve against the Turk.</p>

Florence but allowed Lorenzo to have it copied by a Greek scribe he
sent to Ferrara. Three years later Lorenzo asked the Duke to lend for
a few days the translation of the book by Dione Cassio (Dionysius
Cassius) made for the Duke by Niccolò Leoniceno. Again afraid to trust
the manuscript out of his hands, he had a copy made in all haste by
divers scribes, and sent it as a present to Lorenzo, on the condition
that he was neither to lend it nor to allow it to be published. The
translation was printed for the first time in Venice in 1532, the Greek

Bologna to her assistance, prisoners, and slain the Milanese general
sent by Sforza. Lorenzo took the part of the murdered man’s young son
Astorre, and Giovanni Bentivoglio was kept a prisoner for some weeks

April 8 of that year.) During a visit to Rome in 1486 Pico della
Mirandola had promulgated nine hundred theses on theology, philosophy,
magic, and the Cabbalah, which he offered to maintain in public
disputation. Heresies contained in them were pointed out by his
enemies and Innocent VIII. issued a Brief against those considered as
dangerous. Pico fled to France and published an apology protesting his
orthodoxy, but it was only by Lorenzo’s influence that the Pope was
induced to suspend proceedings. Pico then returned to Florence and
Lorenzo, as this and the two former letters show, pressed the Pope hard
to grant his friend a full pardon.</p>

Firenze, 1898, p. 16. The <i>Biographia Latina</i> of Savonarola

ardent adherent of Savonarola, as authorities. The same story, with
additions, is given by the biographers of Savonarola, Pico della
Mirandola (a nephew of Lorenzo’s friend) and Burlamacchi. “There is,”
says Creighton, “no evidence that Pico, the earliest of them, had
written his book before 1520; whether Burlamacchi wrote independently
or merely re-edited Pico is a question open to discussion.”</p>
